"RM aka Kim Namjoon was the first member to join BTS. The group released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool on June 12, 2013. Apart from RM, BTS also features Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. In an interview with Hypebeast, RM said, ""This is the most difficult question to answer truthfully. Recently, I watched Everything Everywhere All At Once. That film visualized many of the ideas that I’ve had, such as the idea about multiple versions of myself existing based on small choices I made. I often think about what it would have been like if I continued my studies or became something other than a musician."" ""To be honest, one decision that I had often thought about was my choice to become a part of a boy band. In the late 2000s, musicians like Zico, Changmo, and Giriboy were the people that I started out with. In my journey with BTS, I drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that I liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as I – did not have any love for me. I often wondered whether I made the right decision by joining a boy band. At the time, BTS, was treated like a complete outsider in the Korean hip-hop community. That stressed me out. I was constantly thinking about how I would be able to overcome that perception and how to define music or hip-hop,” he added. RM released his first solo mixtape in 2015. Three years later, he released his second mixtape, Mono. RM has collaborated with artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, Lil Nas X, Erykah Badu, and Anderson .Paak. Earlier this month, RM released his first full-length solo album Indigo.","In my journey with BTS, I drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that I liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as I – did not have any love for me.

"BTS ARMY today we are here with a Bangtan Bomb featuring the septet – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook. It's from the Butter Era and features Jung Hoseok aka Hobi's scary side. Yep, you read that right. J-Hope is usually considered as the sunshine of BTS, the most cheerful person. However, there are times when he loses his cool too. And when J-Hope loses his cool, he's the scariest BTS member So, ARMY, we came across a video wherein BTS' eldest member Kim Seokjin aka Jin is seen having a hearty laugh whereas J-Hope is quite serious and kinda furious too. The reason for the same is Kim Namjoon aka RM goofing up with the choreography of Butter. The Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook – performed their popular hit single Butter on The Stephen Colbert Show. And during the take, RM messed up the choreography towards the end. When Jin and Hobi were checking out the tape towards the end, Jin was seen having a hearty laugh whereas J-Hope seems utter serious about the whole thing.' Being the dance lead for BTS, J-Hope looks after the choreography as well. So when anybody goofs up, J-hope immediately catches it and makes him redo it all. This has been seen during the 3J's Megan Thee Stallion X Butter remix choreography. They practised and shot over and over again. Till they got it right Whenever the BTS members goof up the choreography, they naturally look at J-Hope who is already looking at them. It's like he gets it telepathically. It's funny and also a very admirable thing about Hobi, don't you think?","And when J-Hope loses his cool, he's the scariest BTS member So, ARMY, we came across a video wherein BTS' eldest member Kim Seokjin aka Jin is seen having a hearty laugh whereas J-Hope is quite serious and kinda furious too.

Our ARMY, BTS members, family and friends keep me happy and healthy even when I’m hurt and struggling. I cherish human connection. I am a people person and I truly enjoy working with everyone I cross professional paths with, including artists, directors, writers, and journalists like you. In the past, I used to be more reserved because I had been hurt by people who treated me simply as a valuable asset to know and not as a friend. But I still like people. It is thanks to the wonderful people in my life that I am who I am now."" Speaking about the BTS members, V said, ""We are a really positive group and all eager to unconditionally support each other. We had a meeting recently at Suga’s place to play the music we had been working on individually. We were dancing and praising each other non-stop. Being able to pursue one’s own music style lights the passion and enthusiasm in us. That’s what keeps us in love with what we do. I love seeing that.""

"During the episode, the members took a trip down memory lane as they visited their dorms, spoke about eating icecreams, visiting a particular restaurant and taking walks near their dorm. They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, 'You eat it all'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, 'Back to our dorm'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn't want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other's locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed 'my friend' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, ""We can go back to a place we've been already."" He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, ""I'll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase."" However, he got shy and couldn't ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested 'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, "" I want to try pole dancing too.""

"BTS leader RM and his agency Big Hit Music shut down claims suggesting that RM is dating someone. The rumours stemmed from a YouTube video posted on Thursday. As reported by Soompi, a video claimed that the BTS leader was dating a woman of his same age. The channel also claimed that he has been in a relationship with her since 2019. Big Hit on Friday issued a statement clarifying the claims. “The dating rumours involving RM are not true,” the agency said. Shortly after, RM took to Weverse and clarified his stand as well. “I don't know the person at all and the poodle is my friend's poodle,” he wrote on Weverse, as translated by BTS fan account @BTStranslation_ on Twitter. The speculation comes shortly after the agency had to shut down dating rumours about Jungkook. Earlier this week, a YouTuber claimed that Jungkook was dating Yumi's Cells star Lee Yoo Bi. In a video, the YouTuber claimed that Lee Yoo Bi is a fan of Jungkook and has been engaging in ‘lovestagram’ by sharing purple hearts on her Instagram account, a colour mostly associated with BTS. He video also pointed out that Jungkook's older brother and Lee Yoo Bi’s younger sister follow each other on the platform. However, Big Hit clarified that the claims are false. Lee Yoo Bi's agency Y-Bloom Entertainment also issued a statement to shut down claims. “That’s a groundless [rumour]. Lee Yoo Bi and Jungkook’s dating news make no sense. They’ve never met, and they don’t know each other. Among the BTS members, Lee Yoo Bi knew Suga, but that was a long time ago. We don’t even know if they’re in touch right now,” the statement read. A few weeks ago, even V was subjected to dating rumours. However the agency clarified that he is not seeing anyone. BTS members are currently on a break from work. RM, Jin and Suga are recovering from Covid-19 whereas J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are busy with their personal life. Despite the break, BTS members have been engaging with fans on various social media platforms.","He video also pointed out that Jungkook's older brother and Lee Yoo Bi’s younger sister follow each other on the platform.

"ARMY took to Twitter to share pictures of the tattoo, that appears to be RM's tribute to his seven-member band. 7 was also the name of the band's 2020 album. The fans are convinced that other members of the K-pop group must have also gotten similar tattoos, as they had previously discussed on several occasions. V had spoken about it on Weverse, saying, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM had also talked about it in a V Live, revealing that they have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo.

"This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here's a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore."" Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time."" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.","As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year.

"BTS member J-Hope aka Jung Hosoek dropped his first solo album Jack In The Box a couple of days ago and it blew away everyone's minds, especially ARMY. J-Hope had earlier expressed his desire to explore himself as an artist and wanted to showcase his darker and extremely raw side and with Jack In The Box, he did exactly the same. It took him 9 years to drop a full-fledged album. Why? Hobi revealed in his appearance on ZICO's show Give Me A Minute Being a BTS member is not an easy thing and life, especially after global success, has become extremely difficult indeed. J-Hope and the rest of the BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook, have been experiencing it firsthand. While RM and Suga have dropped the mixtapes before as solo projects, the other members haven't really explored much. Things are changing now as BTS' Chapter 2 will focus more on the solo projects of the members. RM and Suga are masters at lyrics writing while others have been learning it while being a part of BTS. ZICO asked J-Hope how he works on his solo projects while having a hectic schedule as a BTS member. Hobi shared that it's extremely difficult and he would carry his laptop and a dynamic mic while making music on an overseas schedule and work in a hotel room. ""In the past, I really had no time. We had so many things to do as BTS,"" he shared. Well, it is indeed one of the hard-hitting facts for those who think it's easy for BTS.

"The most popular South Korean pop band BTS is loved by all. BTS has a crazy fanbase across the globe. In an interview with Vogue Korea, Jin recently revealed something about him and his band. The BTS singer revealed that he calls himself “Worldwide Handsome” as “a joke.” Well, ARMY must be knowing that Jin has often been known as “Worldwide Handsome” due to his good looks and charming personality. But, Jin usually calls him “Worldwide Handsome” as he thinks the title is “a joke.” Jin was quoted saying, “Plenty of people is more handsome than me. ‘Worldwide Handsome’ is a joke I like to make for laughs.” He even continued saying, “And there are many people who can sing and dance better than me. I just try hard to achieve a better version of myself, which other people seem to see in me Jin even said that he thinks that every person has been blessed with a special skill. He even added saying that his strength is to look at every situation positively. “Everyone is born with a certain talent, right? I think mine is the ability to quickly forget negative things that have happened and recover from mental fatigue,” he said. Did you know, Jin does not like being serious? Well, in the interview, the singer said, “I hate it when there’s a serious atmosphere. When people are too serious, I always try to lift the mood.” He even said that he does not like to associate himself with people who are serious and cannot let go “Usually, when a serious person and a jovial person have a conversation, one of them gives in. Usually, the conversation ends up becoming serious, but with me, it’s different. One of our staff members is very serious, but when I talk to him, we usually just joke around,” Jin was quoted in an interview with Vogue Korea. He further added saying, “If someone is too serious and I feel we can’t get along, then I just start avoiding them as soon as possible.” Jin even revealed that in 2020 he had set a goal that he wants to live without thinking, but confessed that it is not easy to keep up with his goal. He even said that he does not like to get stressed and does not always like planning Well, recently Suga, RM, and Jin were diagnosed with COVID-19.

BTS then moved to the next location for their interview. As they were asked about the best song for the holidays, Jimin replied ‘Butter’. RM said, ""Butter Holiday Remix and it's crazy."" They later raised a toast with champagne. As they walked back, J-Hope said, ""We did a toast with champagne and now I'm tipsy. I only had two sips and I'm drunk. Cheers!"" Ahead of their performance at Jingle Ball 2021, Jin was seen asking the camera person, ""Is there going to be an audience?"" After getting a reply from the camera crew, he said, ""Then I think this will be a good, cheerful performance. I was working on my birthday without even our fans. It would have been a bit sad. Our fans being with us will be the best present for me."" As they proceeded towards the stage, Jin was seen asking RM, ""Our schedule is officially over now. Could you give your thoughts?"" RM said, ""I'm really happy. We'll see you. See you later."" V, who was walking behind them, said, ""I want to do another concert."" As they left the venue after their performance, Jin told J-Hope, ""It's not bad performing on my birthday. There's this feeling. There's a kick to it. It's good to work on your birthday. Being with our fans is the best."" After their performance, the members got together and cheered for themselves. Suga said, ""It's been almost two years, right? Coming to Jingle Ball, that stage, that feeling!"" J-Hope recalled that it didn't change at all, Jin added that even the size of the stage was the same and V remembered wearing white suits earlier. Jungkook told Jin, ""We celebrated your birthday on stage today."" As they teased and joked with Jin, J-Hope added, ""Meeting fans on birthdays is something else. I'm jealous."" At the end of the video, V added, ""Everyone, we had our first concert in two years, right? But that's not the end. What else do we have left? There's another concert in March. What should we do to prepare for our March concert? We need to practice. We're going to Korea to practice for our concert.""

At first, they performed Dynamite (Holiday Remix) followed by Butter.  BTS then moved to the next location for their interview.  Being with our fans is the best.  But we're still grateful to be invited.  Could you give your thoughts?"" RM said, ""I'm really happy.  I only had two sips and I'm drunk.  I was working on my birthday without even our fans.  I wish we could have come (to the Jingle Ball) in better shape.  I'm jealous.  It would have been a bit sad.  It's good to work on your birthday.  Jungkook told Jin, ""We celebrated your birthday on stage today.  Our fans being with us will be the best present for me.  RM said, ""Butter Holiday Remix and it's crazy.  See you later.  Simultaneously, they were seen going over the interview questions.  The BTS members then headed to the red carpet.  The members are scheduled to hold a concert in Seoul, South Korea, next month.  The video was dropped on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel on Saturday.  There's a kick to it.  There's this feeling.  V and Jimin were joined by the other members as they started blinking rapidly.  We'll perform with a happy heart.  We'll see you.  We're going to Korea to practice for our concert.  What else do we have left? There's another concert in March.  What should we do to prepare for our March concert? We need to practice. "" After their performance, the members got together and cheered for themselves. "" As they proceeded towards the stage, Jin was seen asking RM, ""Our schedule is officially over now. "" As they teased and joked with Jin, J-Hope added, ""Meeting fans on birthdays is something else. "" At the end of the video, V added, ""Everyone, we had our first concert in two years, right? But that's not the end. "" BTS members had travelled to the US for their four in-person concerts in Los Angeles last year in November. "" The members were next seen having their meals together. "" They later raised a toast with champagne. "" V, who was walking behind them, said, ""I want to do another concert",5.718400136098599,2022-02-13T08:00:00Z,2,1

"Bangtan TV dropped a behind-the-scenes video aka BTS of BTS member Jungkook's recording Charlie Puth and his latest single, Left And Right. And the new episode of Bangtan TV is full of adorable and gush-worthy. BTS' Golden Maknae is exceptionally hardworking, y'all already know, ARMY. And this behind-the-scenes video of BTS' Jungkook will reiterate the same. Let's check out the unmissable moments of Jungkook from his recording of Left and Right BTS' youngest member Jungkook is still learning English and he struggled with a couple of words and sentences. Jungkook was seen practising the pronunciation of the word 'tangled' over and over and singing the verse over and over. It just shows how much he wants it to be perfect for the ARMY and all the fans even though he is pronouncing the word properly In the middle of the recording of Left and Right, Jungkook was seen warming up on PSY and Suga's That That. He did the choreo of the hookstep of That That while listening to his take. It would have been just days after That That was released and he knew the choreo already. Jungkook is a fast learner indeed Jungkook works hard and never gets tired of it. He would keep on rehearsing till the time he is satisfied with the take and will keep on working even if he has given his best. BTS' Jungkook was seen rehearsing a lot, working on his diction, pronunciation and getting the feel right Everyone knows Jungkook is a big fan of Charlie Puth and his music. JK was seen praising Charlie for working on something different this time and approaching him for a song. He talked about how Charlie's music has inspired him and expressed gratitude for getting this opportunity In the middle of the Left and Right recording, Jungkook went into Opera mode and sang the song in that style. The video editors at Bangtan TV put a funny caption saying that it was for ARMY's entertainment Like his struggle with the word tangled, Jungkook also struggled to get the feel for 'I can feel you over hear,' right. He kept rehearsing and getting the opinions of his producer. It just shows, how passionate he is about his work.

"Jungkook also spoke about interacting with the audience at the BTS Las Vegas concert in English. He said that though people appreciated him, he doesn't think he's ‘good’ or 'anything to be proud of'. Jungkook revealed that if he could speak in English throughout the concert, without a teleprompter, he’d say he ‘improved a whole lot’. He added, “I’m not quite there yet.” In an interview with Weverse magazine, Jungkook spoke about his voice, ""To be honest, there’s a lot of times when I don’t like it. Even I think I sounded a little over the top or tried to make my voice sound extremely polished in my old performances when I hear them, but after trying to only sing with my natural voice for some time, I’m starting to feel sort of turned off by it. I know I can make a prettier sound, too, but I’m just trying to sing that way. As far as singing goes, I want my name to become a shorthand for it. A shorthand for singing. I want to receive a lot of recognition and hopefully be able to hear my own singing and think, Wow, I’m really, really good."" Speaking about the songs he wrote, Jungkook said, ""There are so many songs I’ve written that I haven’t been able to release. After making the effort to write them, I should have realised I should just edit them as much as I can and release them, but when I heard them again after a while, they didn’t sound good, so I just deleted them all. I’ve been that way for a very long time. The other members tell me, 'You have to keep making releases. That’s how you figure it all out'. So I’m writing songs lately.""

As far as singing goes, I want my name to become a shorthand for it.  He added, “I’m not quite there yet.  He said that though people appreciated him, he doesn't think he's ‘good’ or 'anything to be proud of'.  However, BigHit later clarified that BTS will be doing ""team and individual projects simultaneously"".  I know I can make a prettier sound, too, but I’m just trying to sing that way.  I want to receive a lot of recognition and hopefully be able to hear my own singing and think, Wow, I’m really, really good.  I’ve been that way for a very long time.  Jungkook revealed that if he could speak in English throughout the concert, without a teleprompter, he’d say he ‘improved a whole lot’.  So I’m writing songs lately.  That’s how you figure it all out'.  The other members tell me, 'You have to keep making releases. "" On Tuesday, BTS announced that they're taking a break from the group to focus on their solo careers in an emotional video appearance. "" Speaking about the songs he wrote, Jungkook said, ""There are so many songs I’ve written that I haven’t been able to release. Jungkook also spoke about interacting with the audience at the BTS Las Vegas concert in English. ” In an interview with Weverse magazine, Jungkook spoke about his voice, ""To be honest, there’s a lot of times when I don’t like it",6.050626138133691,2022-06-15T07:00:00Z,2,10
"The singer, while walking, smiled and made heart gestures with his hands at the BTS ARMY. Jungkook also placed his hand on his chest and bowed before entering the venue.

In several pictures, Jungkook stood on a street and many fans said that the singer is in Doha. He was also seen jumping and dancing with several people. Another clip emerged of the singer riding a cart with a few persons. Jungkook kept on waving at fans and the paparazzi stationed outside the venue. After getting off the cart, he again waved at the people before getting inside his car. ""Jungkook probably tired from working the whole day but he didn’t stop waving goodbye to fans even if he was already inside the car… the sweetest... also the security is no joke as they should,"" wrote a person on Instagram. Jungkook was spotted at the Seoul airport on Monday as he bowed, waved and made finger hearts at his fans. He wore a black sweatshirt, dark grey pants and slippers. He also wore glasses and had a mask on his face. The singer carried a beverage and a bag with him. His travel comes just a week after BTS agency BigHit Music announced that the group will serve their mandatory military duties under South Korean law. The announcement effectively ended the debate on whether they should be granted exemptions because of their artistic accomplishments. As per the agency, at first, Jin will revoke his request to delay his conscription at the end of the month and undertake the required steps.

"In the over-four-minute-long song, Benny turns into the quintessential ARMY. The video starts with a view of his purple-themed room decorated with posters, cutouts and cushions of the BTS members. The video continues to show '13 hours until BTS concert' for which Benny excitedly gets ready. In the video, Benny dances to BTS' track Dynamite, bakes a purple cake, and designs a placard with cutouts of BTS members. He then wears a similar outfit worn by Jimin in Dynamite as he heads to the concert. However, he faces obstacles as the cake gets ruined, he gets stuck in a traffic jam and has to run to the concert only to face another blow--he is at the venue a day early. The music video ends with him waiting outside the venue gate for the next day. Reacting to the video, a fan commented, ""The song reflects the spirit of summer very well. He showed us exactly what the Army is like. I seem to see myself. I love it. The vocal line did a great job again."" ""Great great song guys. Snoops vocals oh my god. Vocal line tops everything.

"BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video. The clip, released on Sunday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed them during their lunch break at the Crosswalk Concert on The Late Late Show With James Corden. As the video started, BTS members came to have their lunch after their performance on the show. As Jungkook took a peek inside his packed lunch of chipotle, he asked, "" How do you eat this?"" Later, as he mixed his food with a sauce, he was seen asking a crew member, ""What is this, chicotle?"" As he asked, ""chipotle?"" J-Hope said, ""I thought they said chocolate at first."" Jungkook announced that ""the sour cream is good"" to which J-Hope asked, ""Fight? Fight what?"" He joked about the English words 'sour cream' and Korean word 'fight'. Jungkook then said, ""It's that sour sauce that tastes like yoghurt."" RM not seen in the video, was heard asking, ""Someone's fighting?"" to which Jungkook replied, ""No."" J-hope burst out laughing as his ‘sour cream’ and 'fighting' joke tricked RM. As Jungkook and J-Hope shared the bowl of chipotle, the former said, ""This is good. I love this."" J-Hope too enjoyed the lunch as he was seen mouthing 'wow'. As he put a spoonful of chipotle in his mouth, Junkook said, ""I want to eat this every day."" Jin and Suga also came to try the dish. Jin asked Jungkook, ""How do you eat this?"" Jungkook was seen telling Suga as he handed him something, ""Just this one."" J-Hope chimed in, ""I think Yoongi would like it a lot."" As Jimin too joined his group members, RM came over and said, ""I also like this kind of food. How are they different?"" Someone at the back said, ""I don't know"" and another person replied, ""There's one steak and one chicken."" RM said, ""I'll get the steak."" Jimin asked, ""Is this it?"" Another person at the back asked, ""What else is there?"" Speaking to the camera person, Jimin said, ""Jungkook was eating this"" as he mixed his chipotle. As RM checked the sauce, he said, ""I tried this a long time ago."" Jimin urged him, ""Put them all in. It's not spicy."" RM responded, ""Really?"" and continued, ""I can't trust you guys when you say it's not spicy."" Jin was seen asking J-Hope, ""Do you eat it with a spoon?"" Later both RM, Suga and Jimin enjoyed their meal as they sat outdoors enjoying the sun. Next, Jin was seen struggling with the sauce and found one with cilantro. V joined them and asked, ""Isn't it too spicy for you too?"" J-Hope replied, ""But I'm hungry."" V informed him that instead of the chipotle he placed an order for another dish. ""I ordered a hamburger,"" V said. As Jin tried his dish, he laughed and said, ""I can't be a maestro. Because I can't handle cilantro."" He seemingly found the dish spicy and hot. J-Hope was seen asking Jungkook what he ate, to which the youngest member replied steak. J-Hope then tried to convince Jungkook to share another round of chipotle with him. He said, ""One more? Wanna share?"" As Jungkook said, ""Eh"" J-Hope said, ""Failed."" Then, J-Hope was seen pouring the spicy sauce into a chipotle dish as he made noises. Jungkook, standing next to him said, ""It's not like you're pouring all of it so..."" J-Hope kept on making weird sounds as he poured drops of the sauce. Jungkook then asked him to mix it together, ""Shake it. Shake it."" He also fashioned a song on avocado, ""Avocado tastes so good."" The duo shared the bowl together as the video ended. Last year, during their visit to the US, BTS members featured in the crosswalk performance for James' show. They had performed their songs including Permission to Dance, Butter and Dynamite. They had appeared on James' show for an interview and also performed Butter in the studio.

Jimin, after finishing making the bracelets, said, ""I'll wear one on each wrist. It went faster than I expected."" Wearing them he showed it to the camera and said, ""These are the nice bracelets I made. I'm so satisfied and had so much fun. The hammering was especially fun for me. The shaping process was fun. The sawing part was the hardest. It was so fun. If ARMY wants to try this kind of hobby too or if you want to make something valuable for yourself in a quiet place, it'll be fun to go to a workshop like this.""

"BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood. She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Two of the four opted out leaving Lenka and Brazil’s Gabriela Dalcin as the final contestants. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm. I too wanted to pursue dancing but could not fulfil the dream as my father did not approve of it. I do not know if my daughter would become the first K-pop idol from India, but I am happy that she is living her dream.” In a statement, DR Music said Lenka and Dalcin were undergoing basic practice and Korean language education. “They will go through...six months of training. It is the final audition. We have prepared to prove through the training process that they themselves are eligible to debut as K-pop artists. Therefore, we will evaluate whether they have the basic skills to perform as a K-pop artist, such as their personality and qualities...” Sonali said her cousin’s schedule is hectic. By the time she returns to her room, she is completely exhausted. “We have formed a family WhatsApp group in which she sometimes chats. But the conversations are very brief.”","A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali.

"The oldest BTS members are Jin and Suga at 29, followed by J-Hope at 28, RM at 27, and Jimin and V at 26. The youngest member is Jungkook at 24 years old. Jin and Suga face enlistment by December this year. However, South Korea culture, sports and tourism Minister Hwang Hee has given BTS ARMY hope that the band may not have to join the military. As per Allkpop, Hwang Hee said that he has proposed that global icons from South Korea, including award-winning athletes and musicians, should be allowed to substitute mandatory military service for other alternative programmes in recognition of their role in promoting the country's image abroad. He also said that he has asked the parliament to approve a relevant bill as early as possible. Hwang Hee said during a press briefing in Seoul on Wednesday, ""It's time to create a system for incorporating popular culture-art figures as art personnel. The system has been operated meaningfully to give those who have enhanced the national status based on their excellent skills more chances to contribute to the country, and there is no reason the popular art-culture field should be excluded from this."" Talking about the seven-member K-pop group BTS, which has fans all across the world, Hwang Hee said, ""I thought somebody should be a responsible voice at a time when there are conflicting pros and cons ahead of the enlistment of some of the BTS members."" He noted that forcing the BTS members to take a hiatus from their music career to serve in the military would cause a great loss to South Korea and the rest of the world. The members themselves have maintained that they will accept the military service whenever they are enlisted. However, their fans have repeatedly advocated for an exemption. ARMY welcomed the culture minister's latest statement, with one saying, ""They (BTS) don’t need it. They deserve it."" Another fan commented, ""Yes BTS contributed a lot to the economy of Korea, it's more than enough to serve their military service.""

"BTS members Jimin and V featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, ""You've to straighten your arms."" He replied, ""I can't go any higher because of the jacket. Here's the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him)."" As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, ""Now we only have one last shooting left."" V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, ""It's what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We'd get greedy and want to show more for our fans."" Jimin then added, ""We are talking now."" Pointing at V, he said, ""He used to do this a lot."" V added, ""It's true that I used to say things like that."" The video ended with Jimin and V talking in 'sim' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other's legs. All the BTS members, who are on an 'extended period of rest', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month. This will be BTS' first show for th live audience in Seoul since the coronavirus pandemic began. The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul's Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group's agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.","In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards.

"BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - also known as the Bangtan Boys have been ruling the hearts since 2013, their debut showcase. And those who got to know about the Bangtannies now and are yet to explore their initial days are in for a treat. BTS members have been helluva goofy ever since they started training. And today, we are here with a throwback video of BTS members from the Dark & Wild era. Once, the Bangtan Boys dropped a video on Bangtan TV wherein they turned a corridor into their ramp and flaunted their OTT ramp walk A year after their debut, the BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook - switched on their crazy side and decided to pretend to walk the ramp. It was late in the night, and the boys were in for some mischief and some fun it seems. They turned a corridor of their room into a ramp and pretended to be models and showcased their 'walks'. Of course, each of them went OTT and it's only going to leave the ARMY, laughing out loud The Bangtan Bomb video begins with Suga aka Min Yoongi. He oozes swag in his walk but it's certainly OTT. The posture he strikes before walking back will make you think whether he really is the calm and cool Yoongi. Up next is Jimin aka Park Jimin. He is like a bratty kid left loose in the park who tries to be a bully but backs off because, Jimin's kiddo, after all After Jimin, it's Jungkook aka the Golden Maknae's turn. It seems someone pushed Jungkook on the ramp forcefully. And now, he has to make it look cool. Jungkook looked like the kid who would brag but it's all just false pretence.  Towards the end, JK strikes the spiderman-style pose and it's hilarious. Next, we have is J-Hope aka Jung Hoseok. He's got the style in his walk but later goofs it up with his real personality. J-Hope is the funniest in this one. The fourth member to walk the corridor ramp is V aka Kim Taehyung. And y'all would know how much Taetae loves being extra! His dance before walking back would make you think if he's possessed or something. However, V ends it pretty smoothly It's RM's turn to walk the ramp. But instead of walking, he's just jumping around like an overexcited kid in the whole lot who later gets conscious and calms the hell down. Next comes the conjuring X star Jin, walking with the up in the bow pose, in the scariest manner. He falls down and but gets up only to walk in the most threatening manner as though challenging people to laugh. Lastly, they all walk the ramp, we mean, the corridor together. Taehyung, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook are still being extra while Jin turns into a cool kid. Suga seems to be trying to kick off the pain of his joints while RM's still conscious of his ramp walk. Watch the goofy and funny throwback BTS video here: It's been nine years since BTS' debut. And though they have considerably matured and evolved as people, they still are childish somewhere. Run BTS has been the proof of the same. ARMY, you'd be glad to have Run BTS back, no?","He is like a bratty kid left loose in the park who tries to be a bully but backs off because, Jimin's kiddo, after all After Jimin, it's Jungkook aka the Golden Maknae's turn.

But the law provides special exemptions for athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers who have won top prizes in certain competitions that enhance national prestige. Recently, news agency AP, reported that commissioner of the Military Manpower Administration Lee Ki Sik told lawmakers on Friday that it’s “desirable” for BTS members to fulfil their military duties to ensure fairness in the country’s military service. Earlier this week, Defence Minister Lee Jong-sup made almost identical comments about BTS at a parliamentary committee meeting, and Culture Minister Park Bo Gyoon said his ministry would soon finalize its position on the issue. Several amendments of the conscription law that would pave the way for BTS members to be exempted have been introduced in the National Assembly, but haven't been voted on with lawmakers sharply divided on the matter. Without a revision of the law, the government can take steps to grant special exemptions. But past exemptions for people who performed well in non-designated competitions triggered a serious debate about the fairness of the system. Since the draft forces young men to suspend their professional careers or studies, the dodging of military duties or creation of exemptions is a highly sensitive issue. The public too remains sharply divided over whether BTS should be given exemptions. In a recent survey, about 61% of respondents supported exemptions for entertainers such as BTS, while in another, about 54% said BTS members should serve in the military. In August, Lee Jong-sup had said if BTS members join the military, they would likely be allowed to continue practising and to join other non-serving BTS members in overseas group tours. People who are exempted from the draft are released from the military after three weeks of basic training. They are also required to perform 544 hours of volunteer work and continue serving in their professional fields for 34 months.","Earlier this week, Defence Minister Lee Jong-sup made almost identical comments about BTS at a parliamentary committee meeting, and Culture Minister Park Bo Gyoon said his ministry would soon finalize its position on the issue.

"The BTS leader also spoke about his Instagram page which feels is 'kind of a curation' of art pieces. Speaking on fans visiting a museum after he has been there and posted pictures, RM called it 'really great that people could love one’s taste and be there'. He added that if 300 people see the same artwork, 'that’s 300 different feelings'. Speaking on Intersections Season 2 podcast, RM said, “This is my first time actually saying this but seriously, I am planning to make a small space of my own private collection and then just make a cafe on the first floor and set up my collections on the second floor and third floor. People could always see the collections when they just want to see them. Because when people come to Korea, and it happens for the Koreans too, we can’t see the great Korean artists because there aren’t many museums right now. There are not many galleries right now. I just want to make my own some time."" RM also spoke about being a part of BTS and their sacrifices, ""Being a team member it does mean that we have to sacrifice our own soul or own personality, we have to cut it out because there are seven personalities and we were 19 or 18 when we started as a team but now we’re almost 30. We became men and adults so we have different characters or maybe different future visions. But BTS is still really important for me, it’s the biggest part of me. But keeping this intensity as a team made me easy to forget who I was & why I started this thing. I just want to remind and reminisce myself as to why I started this, what can I do with my own thing. So for my 30s, I just want to figure out the way to exist like half for BTS member and leader RM and maybe just Namjoon Kim as himself."" RM spoke about himself and BTS days after the group, comprising him, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook released their anthology album Proof. The new album consists of several new and old songs. Recently, Proof scored the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart, thus making BTS win their sixth chart-topper.","Speaking on Intersections Season 2 podcast, RM said, “This is my first time actually saying this but seriously, I am planning to make a small space of my own private collection and then just make a cafe on the first floor and set up my collections on the second floor and third floor.

"This isn't the first time that Simu has spoken about being a fan of BTS. In May 2018, a fan tweeted a few of the Kim’s Convenience cast and asked if they liked BTS. Simu had replied, ""Everyday we vibin'/ mic drop BAM."" The line is from the BTS song Mic Drop. Over the years, Simu has time and again asserted that he likes the group. Recently speaking with Jason Y, Simu said, ""My bias is Rap Monster. I’ll tell you why. He feels very much like the mouthpiece of BTS, like the heart and soul.

"Run BTS' new episode featuring RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook is out and it's such an emotional moment for all the ARMYs. It's been 10 months since the last Run BTS episode dropped on Weverse. The new Run BTS episode is called Telepathy. And it's so much fun to see the boys get together and play the game again, just like the good old days. Along with the Run BTS episode, back were Bangtan Boys aka RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Kim Taehyung and Jungkook's goofy personalities. Let's check out the most heartwarming moment of Run BTS' latest episode In the latest episode of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtannies playing the Telepathy game. In the first game, they had to guess letters each based on questions. The telepathy of the Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - kinda failed for various reasons. TBH, we have to give it to the Run BTS producers/ directors who increased the difficulty level of Run BTS with such a game. The second was the game of guessing the gestures and it had to be Telepathically matched with the other members. Suga, Hobi and RM goofed up a couple of times. It was fun to see their expressive side back again. In this segment the Bangtan Boys worked hard on their acting skills, Jin and Taetae were quite natural So, the most heartwarming moment of the telepathy between four of the Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Jimin and Taehyung. It so happened that the septet were made to wear masks. They were taken to the lobby and were made to sit in different cars and were handed out clues each. They were given clues in terms of words and were asked to guess the destination and reach there. The clues for the first round were 'Real Fun'. Jimin, Taehyung, Jin and RM felt their old dorm was the place they had the most fun. Suga went to the Han River whereas J-Hope reached Jamsil Stadium where they had practised the most. Jungkook, on the other hand, had at first thought about the dorm too. But he later switched the destination to the far away place of Lotte World. The reunion of Jin, Taehyung, Jimin and RM through telepathy was indeed a heartwarming moment At the end of the Run BTS episode, we saw RM, Jimin and Taehyung discussing having thoughts of Lotte World too but had opted out due to the distance. Now, in the next episode of Run BTS, we will see three more rounds of destination telepathy being played. The clues for the second round are Salty or Mad. What could be the destination, ARMY, any guesses?","In this segment the Bangtan Boys worked hard on their acting skills, Jin and Taetae were quite natural So, the most heartwarming moment of the telepathy between four of the Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Jimin and Taehyung.

In an interview with Ize magazine, V had said, ""I was so moved after watching a video of Danny Jung and started playing the saxophone for three years.

"A couple of days ago, J-Hope aka BTS' Jung Hoseok released the MV and song, the lead single of the new album Jack in the Box, More. And when it was released, BTS ARMY had turned into Sherlock and had found Taetae aka BTS V in the video. J-Hope's More video featured a glimpse of Kim Taehyung.

He was engrossed in the scene of the shoot and was pleasantly surprised to see Kim Taehyung on the sets. Hobi couldn't stop smiling and was grateful for V to come and cheer on him.

Taetae is one of the biggest cheerleaders of the hyung and the rapline and he has proved it a lot of times already.

After shooting the scene, Hobi quickly deduces that ARMYs will right away catch his cameo in the MV. And he was right!

"BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from the 2021 American Music Awards. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed the members practising Butter on stage. BTS' Jin and Suga got nostalgic and recalled performing their track DNA at the awards four years ago. The members were then seen discussing their parts, coordinating steps for the show and giving feedback. After Butter, they practised with Coldplay for their collaborative track My Universe. As they got ready on the last day of their dress rehearsal, Jin said, ""(Chris) Martin seemed to be enjoying the performance more than we expected. So I think we'll be able to have more fun as well. It's our first collaboration performance on-air, so we'll bring out all the fun and excitement."" RM said, ""This feels so unfamiliar. It's strange seeing people entering (the venue). There's a lot to memorise too. So I think we won't know until it actually begins. I know it'll turn out fine though. I think we'll have to get used to it quick."" Suga added: “It's our first time being a nominee for Artist of the Year (in the US), so we're very excited. I'm really nervous. I'm really sleepy but we're going to go rehearse Butter for the AMAs.” On the day of the award ceremony, as the members got ready, V was seen practising his speech in front of the camera. The members then got into their cars as they drove towards the venue. While J-Hope and V were seen together in one car, RM and Jimin travelled in another vehicle. Jin, Suga and Jungkook went together to the awards ceremony. In the car, as V kept repeating his lines, J-Hope started laughing. He then told V, ""We prepared so much, but once we go in, we won't be able to do much of what we prepared. I once didn't say anything I prepared."" V added that it happened to him too. ""When I prepared a lot of things to say, I was so ready, 'I'm going to pour out all the English I know today'. But I was basically silent. I'll try to succeed this time. I only memorised the main points. So I think it'll be okay."" As J-Hope and V enjoyed some fun moments, RM and Jimin were tense. The BTS leader said, ""Let's try to enjoy the awkwardness. You can be at the top if you can enjoy even this feeling."" Jimin joked, ""We're not celebrities, RM"" making the latter laugh. He continued, ""We're just Kim Najoon and Park Jimin. We're far from celebrities. About 420 km far?"" RM said, ""That's not how the world goes. We don't fix that kind of title."" Of all the members, Suga, Jin and Jungkook were the most relaxed. As he sat at the back of the car, Jungkook said, ""If they ask about New Years Resolution I can reply immediately."" Jin then quizzed him about his outfit to which he replied immediately. On reaching the venue, the BTS members changed outfits and discussed their performance of My Universe. After their My Universe performance ended, Jungkook said, ""I'm so tired because I didn't get much sleep last night. But I'll focus hard and get through it. I'll make sure I don't regret anything about today's performance."" At the AMAs, BTS won the Artist of the Year, favourite Pop Duo/Group and favourite Pop Song. Returning to their dressing room after their speech, an upset V said, ""I just kept on... seriously. Suddenly Namjon says 'You finish it off'. What about me?"" RM added, ""After I was done, 10 seconds later they were already signalling us to finish."" As he couldn't complete his speech on stage, V said, ""I'm going to give my speech here."" He then gave his speech. Jungkook, who was teased by the members for giving a long speech, laughed and said, ""Fans are going to tease me a ton. ARMY is going to make fun again, what do I do? I wanted to look cool. Getting dragged off at the end."" RM consoled him saying, ""Just accept it and go home."" Jimin opined that giving a speech was more nerve-wracking than performing onstage: ""I think I'm gonna die. My heart feels like it's gonna burst."" After their performances at the AMAs ended with Butter, the members called it fun adding that it was like a teaser for their Los Angeles concerts. As the video ended, the members gathered around and excitedly spoke about the difference between performing in front of a crowd and online.","As he sat at the back of the car, Jungkook said, ""If they ask about New Years Resolution I can reply immediately.

"Recently, Jungkook along with the other group members RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and V held a live session on V Live. However, Jin wasn't present with them as he underwent surgery for his finger injury. During the live, a fan asked, ""What happened to Jungkook’s shirt during Fake Love?"" At this, Suga asked if the button really popped off and Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @btsbaragi_jk, ""It got unbuttoned."" The other members started teasing him. Suga asked, ""You didn’t do that on purpose?"" Jimin said, ""You seemed to be continuously laughing and smiling as you performed."" RM said, ""I saw him before we went in (on stage) and he was pulling it off (at the thread) a lot."" Jungkook said, ""The reason I laughed is because I buttoned it up once but it got undone again so I was dumbfounded."" Suga reminded RM that previously he had once accidentally ripped off Jungkook's buttons. To this Jungkook, added, ""I did give it a thought. Since its already unbuttoned, should I unbutton another one? Should I just completely unbutton it?’"" V chimed in saying, ""I think it would be nice if you performed by taking it off one day."" Jungkook replied, ""No, not for me. I’m not ready yet."" Jimin added, ""As far as I know, at the time, the fans couldn’t hold back their cheers and a sound came out of their mouths."" He was speaking of the time during the concert when Jungkook's blazer got unbuttoned. Suga asked Jungkook, ""I heard you went in after putting in on oil on day three."" While RM and J-Hope laughed, Jungkook said, ""But I always do that since I have to show my abs. Always have to be prepared."" Speaking about Jin, Suga said that he is taking rest and Jimin added that he is recovering well. RM said, ""Don't worry too much, you guys, he said he's okay. The surgery was short and he's okay honestly."" The live saw Jin's representative, BT21 character RJ's soft toy. Referring to it, Jungkook said, ""That's why this friend came (RJ). Jimin said, ""Jin hyung (brother) told us to convey his greeting to you guys. We saw him today"" and RM added, ""On seeing him, he was doing fine.""

"BTS members have spoken about a host of topics concerning them in the past year and also this new year. In an interview, the group members spoke about an ability they would want to acquire this year, a question that provokes them, an alternate profession, among other questions. In a video shared by Vogue Korea on YouTube, Jimin was asked about the words that impressed him the most in 2021. Replying to this, he said, “I remember the words, 'It's how it is'. Since the pandemic continues, lots of people are suffering and each person has different hardships and situations. I also went through some difficult times. I wanted to perform and met our fans too. So there was a time when I felt isolated. As time passed, I began to empathize with and felt the pain of the words, 'It's how it is'.” In the special edition interview, Jungkook was asked about the words that he wants to hear the most in 2022. He responded, ""Since there's no one who doesn't like compliments. I guess 'cool' would be the best. 'Cool' could be interpreted in various ways. It could mean the personality's cool or the performance on the stage is cool or the voice is cool. It can explain a lot of things, so I like the words, 'So cool'. So in 2022, I hope to hear such a word."" BTS' V was asked if he could obtain a new ability this year, what would he choose. He replied, “Besides music and dance, I want to get the ability to play the instruments well. When it comes to instruments, one has to invest lots of time into the songs they want to play and in the end, they can feel a huge sense of accomplishment. But, I don't know how to play instruments. I used to play the saxophone often back then, but I found out that it was too hard to play all the songs I love with just saxophone. So, whether it's trumpet, clarinet or violin, I'd like to play all the songs I like, so I assume I'd choose instruments.” Next, J-Hope was asked what is the thing he has always been better at than others. He said, ""When I meet people, I think I'm good at absorbing them. Whoever I meet, I tend to try to go along with them, and I kind of absorb things like a sponge. That would be what I'd call 'a thing I'm better at than others'."" Jin was asked what profession would he want to choose, if not his current one. He answered, ""If I were to do something else as a profession, even though I don't sell stuff, I like to recommend things I got to friends around me. I haven't recommended anything to my members, but I think I'd like to work as a person who persuades that 'This is way better', so buy this one instead. A job of persuading that a certain product is better than others."" Suga was asked that if he were asked a question that provokes him the most, what would it be. ""A question that provokes me? 'What can you accomplish if you're so lazy like that? What would you do with such laziness?' I think this kind of question quite provokes me. I do tend to try hard to live diligently and busily, but I'm still not satisfied, so I split my time even more. I hope to become a more diligent person, so those questions would provoke me."" Lastly, BTS leader RM was asked if he was mentioned in the textbook 50 years later, what sentence he would like there. He said, ""If I'm to be included just 'There was this kind of person among K-pop idols'. I hope to be written as one of those 'examples'. A very unique person who loved music, worked hard and challenged on things. Just like that, I guess? If I were to be in the textbook, I think I should be an outliner."" He concluded by saying, ""We're already in the textbook, so it's fine."" Last year, BTS members had travelled to the US for four Los Angeles in-person concerts. They returned to South Korea in December. After that, BTS announced that they will be taking an 'extended period of rest', their first since 2019.","He answered, ""If I were to do something else as a profession, even though I don't sell stuff, I like to recommend things I got to friends around me.

"Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, has previously co-written and released three solo tracks with BTS: Awake, Epiphany, and Moon. Talking of solo projects in his recent interview, he also spoke about how he struggled to handle something on his own. He told Weverse magazine about presenting something on his own, ""It used to be that any time I had to do something, I thought it was such a big deal. Like, How can I handle something this big right now? I would always feel discouraged, but my personality has changed a lot now, I think. I think the biggest change in my mind is that now, even if there’s a major project in the works, I think I can do it now. Now, instead of, 'How can I handle this?' it’s 'I can handle this!' when I’m making songs for other people to listen to."" The musician, who released a new version of Epiphany in BTS' recent album proof, revealed that it was part of his new personality, where he does what he wants when he wants, When asked if this is his way to strike a balance between the band and his personal life, Jin said 'he wants to be able to have fun on his own too without inconveniencing anybody else.' He then teased a potential solo Variety show, saying, ""I thought about going on a variety show to make myself happy, not for the group or because of my popularity or for work, because filming those shows might put me in a happy mood. There are some things about variety shows that are tough, of course, but it’s also a chance to laugh your head off on set all day. I talked about how I felt like I was watching both the other members and ARMY at the most recent concert, right? So I want to do it to enjoy myself - I’m on stage and putting on a performance, but watching a BTS concert up-close at the same time. I’m on a variety show, but watching that show up-close."" At the streamed dinner, the band members had promised the ARMY that they will be back one day, while Jin had said, ""Remember nothing works according to plans,"" talking of how many times their plans have changed previously. Big Hit later clarified that the band members were talking about shifting their focus on their solo careers instead of announcing a hiatus.","I talked about how I felt like I was watching both the other members and ARMY at the most recent concert, right?

The picture has not only captured the attention of his fans, but BTS members have also commented on it. Soon after he shared the post, J-Hope wrote in the comments, “Holy moly!” ""Oh, I was shocked. I Thought you weren’t wearing pants either,” jokingly commented BTS leader RM. To this, Jin replied, “Then it’s a crime.” Jin’s pictures have now gone viral among fans on Twitter.

"BTS member Jin celebrated his birthday yesterday. The eldest BTS member came live for a short time period and celebrated his birthday with the ARMYs. Another BTS member, Park Jimin aka Jimin was also watching Jin live as The Astronaut singer 'cut' the cake and chatted away with the ARMY. Their interactions reminded us of how close each of the Bangtan Boys really are. And we came across a throwback post when Jin dressed up as Jimin. While it might be taken for Seokjin just messing things up for a joke but reports state that it was a very grave situation indeed Sadly, the BTS group has a lot of saesang fans out there. These fans often dish out threats about life to the Bangtan Boys. There are some nasty trolls as well who often dole out threats online without bothering about the consequences or the effects of those threats. Jimin is one of the members who have been getting a lot of hate and death threats online. It could be by solo saesang fans. And that's what happened years ago A saesang fan shared the story of why Kim Seokjin aka Jin and Park Jimin aka Jimin dressed alike at a soundcheck of a BTS concert. It so happened that one of the ARMYs who was present revealed that Jin had copied Jimin's look from head to toe. It was because of the threats that Jimin received. The ARMY was in awe of Jin and wondered what the eldest member was thinking before taking such a step. Koreaboo also reported that other media reports claimed that the person who gave death threats also posted pictures of the seat ticket from the concert online, to show that they were attending the concert As per reports, Jimin was quizzed about the incident at a press conference.

"In the first picture, Jin squatted on the floor as he flashed a victory sign. However, Jungkook stood in front of him, while RM and Jimin posed behind him. In the second photo, Jin again posed but this time he was seen bending as he looked at the camera. Jungkook also came in front of Jin trying to block his face. J-Hope also joined RM and Jimin in the background. In another picture, Jungkook was seen holding Jin's hands from behind as J-Hope tried to kick him. RM and Jimin, in the background, were seen looking at the sky. In the next pictures, Jin tried to pose by lifting his hands, while Jimin and Jungkook ran towards him. In a photo, Jin smiled and lifted his hands pointing towards the stadium. Here, too, he was joined by Jimin and Jungkook. While Jungkook pointed his hands towards the sky, Jimin knelt on the floor making a goofy pose. The last picture showed Jin laughing as he again made a similar pose. Though the members didn't feature in the photo, a hand was seen near the camera lens. Another member was also seen trying to photobomb. For their day out, Jin wore a white and blue shirt and paired it with a pair of beige trousers. RM opted for a green T-shirt and black pants, while J-Hope was dressed in a white T-shirt, denims and black shirt. Jimin wore a white T-shirt, shirt and blue denims and Jungkook opted for an all-black ensemble. All of them wore white sneakers. Sharing the pictures, Jin captioned the post, ""Please let me take pictures alone."" Reacting to the post, J-Hope dropped a bunch of laughing emojis. This is not the first time that the members have photobombed Jin. Earlier too on several occasions, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook teased Jin and spoilt his selfies with their goofy poses. Currently, RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are pursuing their solo projects after they announced a break last month.","Currently, RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are pursuing their solo projects after they announced a break last month.

"Recalling his earlier mixtape, RM said that in 2015 he 'called out the rapper side of me I wanted to show off'. In 2018, he 'brought up my personal idols' to express his 'darker, gloomy side that I had been wanting to show'. He added that in 2022, he's hopeful and thinking that 'it might just be enough to convey something while being purely my sincere self'. In an interview with Weverse magazine, RM said, “I think I need to try taking a step away from myself for a minute. I think that way I’ll know what the work I’m doing right now means to me and what it is to me. So now I’m worried if I’m just doing the things I’m given and if I’m losing myself in a way. It was never my intention to live feeling this way, and I want to live an independent and active life, but now I’m starting to wonder if I’m living too passively because of the pandemic, and it’s unbearable. That includes how I felt at the Grammys, and I think I’ve hit a kind of wall. It’s something I felt when I looked at artists like Lady Gaga or H.E.R. who devote their entire lives to their music: We need a message so we can be sure and assert our own image, too.” He said that the Butter performance at the Grammy Awards astonished people and was unique. RM added that it’s time for BTS ‘to move beyond astonishing people and think again about what kind of messages we can send people now'. He also said, ""I think I should be making things that will shine even after time passes. I think I need to approach something that’s more timeless...If I just work without being aware of that, then I have a feeling that, with the way everything’s swept away so quickly now by everything coming out in that time under the fast-changing algorithm, the things I make might look outdated later. It really feels like everything is thrown out after just a few years with how fast the world changes, so it makes me think I want to attain some kind of everlastingness."" Recently, BTS released their anthology album Proof, comprising new as well as old tracks. A few days later, the group said they would take a break, during Festa dinner. HYBE, however, has clarified that BTS is not taking any hiatus.","It really feels like everything is thrown out after just a few years with how fast the world changes, so it makes me think I want to attain some kind of everlastingness.

In another tweet, it added, ""The changed schedules will be announced through a separate notice. We ask for your generous understanding. Thank you."" The announcement comes after over 150 people were killed in a stampede at a Halloween event in Seoul, as per news agency AFP. The crowd surge and crush hit in the capital's popular Itaewon district, where police estimate as many as 100,000 people -- mostly in their teens and 20s -- went to celebrate Halloween Saturday night. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared a period of national mourning on Sunday, telling the country in a televised address that ""a tragedy and disaster occurred that should not have happened"". He said the government ""will thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and make fundamental improvements to ensure the same accident does not occur again in the future"". The postponement of the listening party and The Astronaut lyric video comes after Jin's recent performance of his first-ever solo at Coldplay's concert in Argentina. This was Jin's last live performance ahead of enlisting for mandatory military service.

This put an end to a debate about whether they should be exempt from the mandatory service requirement of about two years. Jin, the eldest of the group, said he would sign up in December.

"The issue of military service for the seven members of the group has been a topic of discussion in the country as BTS' oldest member, Jin, faces enlistment in December when he turns 30. BTS' Jin was born in 1992, Suga in 1993, RM and J-Hope in 1994, Jimin and V in 1995 and Jungkook in 1997. The country has been debating shortening mandatory military service for K-pop stars to three weeks from about two years. As per news agency AP, Jong-sup's comments created a stir following which his ministry clarified in a statement that he ordered officials to examine whether such a survey is needed, instead of launching it immediately. According to the statement, officials were asked to check details including which agency would be responsible for a survey, who exactly would be surveyed and how long would it take. The statement also added that if the survey is carried out, it will not be done by the ministry or related authorities, to ensure fairness. The survey will be done by a third organization. As per AP, the ministry said the results would be only one of the many factors determining BTS members' military status. According to South Korean law, all able-bodied men must serve 18-21 months in the military under a conscription system established to deal with threats from North Korea. However, the country gives exemption to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers who win top places in certain competitions because they are considered to have enhanced national prestige. Those exempted are released from the military after taking three weeks of basic training. But they are required to perform 544 hours of volunteer work and serve in their respective professional fields for 34 months. Some politicians have called for expanding the scope of exemptions to include K-pop stars such as BTS as they have elevated the country's international image significantly. with AP inputs","As per news agency AP, Jong-sup's comments created a stir following which his ministry clarified in a statement that he ordered officials to examine whether such a survey is needed, instead of launching it immediately.

"Sharing the new picture, the company clarified that they didn’t intend to disrespect Jungkook. “Hello everyone, here's the revised version of the previous photo. There was a mistake while editing the skin tone and there was no intention to disrespect the artist. As we promised, this kind of mistake won't take place again.

We sincerely apologise that we've missed the precious ‘J’ letter on JK's hand. We'll soon replace it with the revised version, and make sure it won't happen again.

He is the youngest member of the boy band, Bangtan Seonyeodan also popularly as the Bangtan Boys.  He looked kinda nervous yet he was very calm.  He revealed that he wasn't nervous initially but after entering the audition hall, he was intimidated by the large crowd.  He was a quiet young yet very adorable, well-mannered and shy boy.  He was just a boy.  However, the techniques, styles, hold on the notes and charisma in his voice and visual appeal has shot up, definitely.  It hasn't much changed either.  Jungkook feels that it was during that time he started getting intimidated and feeling shy around strangers.  Jungkook was not selected for the competition, he did win a lot of hearts.  Jungkook's voice is quite impressive for a young boy.  She recalled shrinking seeing so many strange people around him.  They all are passionate about music and have been working very hard from a very young age.  Today, we bring a throwback of the BTS's Golden Maknae Jungkook from his audition days Jungkook joined BTS at the age of 15.

"BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook during their Festa dinner in June spoke about why they wanted a break. RM had said while he enjoyed being in BTS, the group members now feel ""exhausted"" and he doesn't ""know what kind of group we were any more"". Jimin admitted that the group has been going through a ""rough patch"" as it is trying to ""find our identity, and that’s an exhausting and long process"". Now speaking to Reuters, Sang-hyun said that BTS took the break as the 'main reason' of 'waiting for parliament to decide has been hugely stressful' for them. ""The members cited exhaustion and the need for rest as the main reason but the real reason was Jin's military service,"" said Sang-hyun. He added that BTS raised the country's profile worldwide through ""soft power"" and it should be taken into account when considering their military service. ""BTS has done a job that would take more than 1,000 diplomats to do,"" said the lawmaker. South Korea's military service requires all able-bodied men aged between 18 and 28 to serve for about two years. Over the years, particular categories of men have won exemptions--either allowed to put off service for a certain time or allowed to do shorter service--including men who win a medal at the Olympics or Asian Games and classical musicians and dancers who win a top prize at certain competitions. Under a 2019 revision of the law in the country, globally recognised K-pop stars were allowed to put off their service until the age of 30. BTS management company, BigHit Music, has maintained that the group members are keen to do their duty. In April, BigHit official Lee Jin-hyung told a news conference in Las Vegas that some band members were having a ""hard time"" because of ""uncertainties"" over the parliament debate. He called for a decision. When Jin was later asked about Jin-hyung's comments, he said he was letting the company handle the matter. He added that what the official said reflected his view.","In April, BigHit official Lee Jin-hyung told a news conference in Las Vegas that some band members were having a ""hard time"" because of ""uncertainties"" over the parliament debate.

"The lyrics of the song started with: 'You and me an unending history/Oh you became my universe'. The video also showed Jin spending time with a little girl--they played, shared conversations, clicked pictures together and he taught her to ride a bicycle. In the clip, Jin walked and ran through the streets and also came across an astronaut suit. After approaching the burning spacecraft, Jin is transported to a galaxy. The video showed him near the spaceship. However, as it leaves Earth, Jin also comes back home to the little girl. The lyrics of the song also go: 'When I'm with you, there's no one else/I get heaven to myself/When I'm with you, there's no one else/I feel this way I've never felt' and 'When I'm with you, there's no one else/A life, a sparkle in your eyes/Heaven comin' through/And I love you.'

Sharing a video of Jungkook, a fan said, ""Look at how Jungkook asked an army to throw him the rose omg.  Suga too was seen blowing a kiss at the fans during their IDOL performance.  The in-person concert is their first after a gap of over two years owing to the coronavirus pandemic.  The members matched their jumps to ARMY clappers.

"Rapper Snoop Dogg has confirmed his collaboration with K-pop group BTS for an upcoming project. In a recent interview, Snoop Dogg said that their collab is official like 'a referee with a whistle'. He also said that BTS makes good music and so does he. BTS comprises RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Earlier in January, Snoop Dogg revealed that BTS had asked him for a collaboration. This is not the first time that BTS will be collaborating with a solo artist. The group has so far collaborated with Steve Aoki, The Chainsmokers, Nicki Minaj, Halsey, Lauv, Coldplay, Megan Thee Stallion among others. Recently, speaking with The AV Club, Snoop Dogg said, “The BTS experience you keep talking about. I’m going to let them tell you about it. It’s official like a referee with a whistle. I love that entertainment world. It’s good music. It’s [a] vibe. I make good music. They make good music. And we end up doing this. This is what it’s always about, bringing our worlds together.” Earlier this year, Snoop Dogg told Mogul Talk podcast, “I got a group named BTS that's waiting on me to do a song with them right now. And I'm trying to figure out if I got time to do that s***.” Another guest from the show, Crystal Mais had said, “That would be fire. BTS is dope. The K-pop market is huge, Snoop. Do it.” BTS had first hinted at their admiration for the 50-year-old rapper when they included a nod to his debut album Doggystyle in their 2014 track Hip Hop Phile. Currently, BTS is gearing up for their concert in the US next month. BTS recently extended their Permission to Dance On Stage tour by four shows at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The group is set to perform at the venue on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16. Almost all the BTS members have contracted Covid-19 after their US concert, which ended in December last year. In addition to coronavirus, Jin and Jimin had to undergo surgery as well. Last December, Suga, RM, and Jin had tested positive for the coronavirus. In January, Jimin went through surgery for acute appendicitis while also recovering from Covid-19. In February, V tested positive for Covid-19. Last weeek, J-hope also tested positive for coronavirus. His diagnosis comes just ahead of the group's departure for the US, where they are scheduled to perform at the 2022 Grammys ceremony too. BTS have also been nominated at the Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for Butter.","His diagnosis comes just ahead of the group's departure for the US, where they are scheduled to perform at the 2022 Grammys ceremony too.

"Videos of J-Hope’s solo performance are now making rounds on the internet. At the concert, Hobi sported a cream-coloured sweater, paired with a bucket hat and pink sneakers.

"As translated by @yourlove_army on Twitter, Jimin wrote, “I've heard adults say that it'd continue to be like that (in the upcoming years too) but I feel like it's a year of many regrets as it went by so fast. I'm guessing it felt like that even more because it was a year we weren't able to meet you guys that often, isn't it? But still, I think that there were many things that happened this year despite it going by so fast. We laughed cried and were so happy meeting you guys after so long since Covid-19 was over, we released our album and had promotions, we hard a large-scale concert in my hometown Busan, we were able to witness the performances of the albums Hobi hyung and Namjoon hyung worked hard preparing for, and our Seokjin hyung enlisted as well. Hehe.” Jimin shared how he has been busy working on his music and meeting composers. “I just want all of us to go to a place where all of you are there and sing, hear you sing together with us while waving your army bombs, and look at you smile. I keep longing for that always. I think I feel like that cause we weren't able to meet as much as each other wanted to. I somewhat can't put my words together unlike the previous years, I don't know what I'm saying or what I mean.

"BTS member J-Hope performed at the New Year's Times Square celebrations held at New York in the US. He was joined by other artistes like Duran Duran. The rapper and dance leader performed songs like Equal Sign, Chicken Noodle Soup and Dynamite Holiday remix. He fell down during the rehearsals on the slippery stage and hurt his wrist. There were technical snags too. But he handled all the issues and performed like the ace he is. Post that, he did a live on Weverse for ARMYs. He spoke about the performance and wished fans. But the treat was his chat about Jin aka Kim Seokjin He said that Kim Seokjin aka Jin called him from an unknown number from the training centre.

"BTS members RM, Jin, V, and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from last year when they performed at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The video was dropped on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel on Wednesday. It showed the members recording their dance performances to their tracks Butter and Dynamite for the show. Titled BTS’s Chaotic Break Time, the video started with Jungkook giving an update about the members. ""We just finished Dynamite and Butter. We're recording it but the song (Butter) hasn't been released yet. It hasn't hit me yet. Until it's really released we'll keep preparing and practising whenever we have time."" As Jungkook spoke, V stood behind him giving directions to Jin on what to say on camera. At first, Jin spoke about his appearance in the song, ""It's not that I opened the performance fancy. I just stood up and walked. If that looked fancy all I could say is that my face was fancy."" Jin then burst out laughing and said, ""Our members are listening to this through the mic so it's a bit embarrassing."" While talking, Jin kept on shifting his glances at the camera and V. He then showed a finger heart revealing that V asked him to do so. Speaking about V, Jin said, ""He said to say something to the camera. He told me to say ‘Please look forward to it’."" As V continued giving instructions on the mic set, Jin obediently repeated it in the camera, ""He said he loves ARMY. He said he can't wait to hold a concert."" Following this, RM became the next member to feature in the clip. As soon as he showed up, Jin and V joined him and they started interrupting each other's interviews. RM started with, ""Hello. Welcome to the first day of our Butter promotion. I sincerely..."" However, he was cut off by V saying, ""You have nose hair."" As RM moved away, V said in the camera, ""Hello ARMY, I'm Kin Taehyung."" Here Jin said, ""You have mouth hair."" V walked away and Jin said, ""Hello everyone. This is Jin."" But V interrupted saying, ""You have armpit hair."" As he started talking facing the camera, RM came and said, ""You have eye hair."" Smiling at the camera, RM said, ""It's s nice to meet you guys."" As V walked into the frame asking RM, ""You got neck hair?"", Jin told the group leader, ""You look handsome today."" Finally, Jin was able to say, ""Hello. I'm Jin. What we're doing today is recording Butter. It's very awkward since no one's pushing their way in. Fighting!"" Next on V's target was Jungkook. As the youngest member said, ""We'll continue to show you good performances"" V pushed him out of the frame saying, ""Outta my way."" As the video ended, V said, ""Everyone, please look forward to it."" Last year, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook had to participate in a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

"&lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; is BTS&rsquo; fame variety show which used to be a weekly catch-up between the group and their fans as the septet tried on different activities to entertain the fans. It seems as though BTS will be bringing in their 2023 with a loud cheer as ahead of new year&#39;s day, they announced another special episode of the program with all seven members starring in it. The BTS ARMY is particularly celebrating the presence of member Jin who is now serving in the military, becoming the first from the group to do so.

Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&nbsp;

The upcoming episode has been named, &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, and the teaser introduced the chaos that will unfold a week later. The seven members gathered in front of a table setting, ready to play a game of cards. It is likely that more than one game will be played in this episode, which will see the BTS members put their mind to test. With everyone bluffing, it is only natural that they are after the real liar. In another game, it seems as though brain movement/thought-sensitive headbands were placed on their heads with cat ears adding to their adorableness. X and O paddle in their hands, and they test out each other. A shocking revelation seems to await the fans at the end of the upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; special episode.
NrfFsgWSpQUWhile &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; took a break in October last year, it returned a few months ago in August much to the delight of the BTS ARMY. It returned with another change, however, which was the theme song that is regularly updated, now becoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;, the group&rsquo;s hit track from their latest full group release, &lsquo;Proof&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s a full list of all the &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; special episodes you can tune in to so far.

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Telepathy

Assessing the truth behind BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;one body one soul&rsquo; mindset, their knowledge about each other was tested in this episode, While it began lightly with quick questions on their friendship and traits it soon turned into a bigger surprise as the members were &lsquo;kidnapped&rsquo;. With seven cars, each carrying one of them to different locations, they were handed keywords that would steer them towards certain spots engraved in their memory. The game ends once all of them are at the same spot. The whole of Seoul at their disposal, once again their telepathy skills were questioned. Meeting and separating, laughing and reminiscing, do they finally all end up at the same location?

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - Fly BTS Fly

Putting member Jungkook&rsquo;s idea into action, one that he mentioned offhandedly as the others were also throwing random thoughts for upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes, the South Korean superstars headed to try their hand, or should we say mind and boy, at flying yoga. Usually, an activity demonstrated by a female trainer, a skilled young man who was at the receiving end of BTS&rsquo; admiration, trained them at difficult moves. Their one aim? To take Instagrammable photos. And so the grunts and cries for help ensued as the flexible ones like Jimin and Jungkook put their best foot forward while the rest struggled to stay in position. It created hilarious content full of laughter and words of praise from the members for each other as well as for the trainer who was previously seen teaching TOMORROW X TOGETHER. Some BTS members also shared the photos they worked so hard for on Instagram later on.

Run BTS! 2022 Special Episode - &lsquo;RUN BTS&rsquo; TV On-air

The latest edition of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; saw the members each take on their own live broadcasts with the other members as their audience. Jungkook started off by learning some drumming while SUGA painted according to the viewers&rsquo; suggestions. Jin became his famous video gamer self as he stopped himself from exerting extreme anger at the games he played and J-Hope found the perfect hobby for himself as a children&rsquo;s toy broadcaster. V showed off his fabulous golf skills and RM put his wittiness to the test. In the end, Jimin got to eat some unique food items very deliciously as an ASMR broadcaster. Funnily enough, BTS turned on their &lsquo;mean&rsquo; sides while continuously commenting and asking for appropriate interaction during the said lives, earning hilarious responses from those on camera.&nbsp;

Run BTS re-release

Recently, it was announced that the program &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; which used to be exclusive to VLive at first along with Weverse later, would be made available on YouTube. While the Special Episodes of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; were also simultaneously released on the video giant, the earlier editions which dated back to 2015 when the show first began will also be re-released in a span of 3 days as a Christmas gift to the BTS ARMY. This could be a result of HYBE acquiring VLive through its subsidiary Weverse Company.

J-Hope

Being his hope-filled and vibrant self, the BTS member got to business by introducing the various toys at his disposal  J-Hope himself was more surprised at the different types of items available in the market  A peculiar flamingo who would repeat his words caught the attention of the BTS members and they began making fun of it

Leader RM used his skills in a game of world cup where he chose one of the cutest animals with the help of the other BTS members  He would get two options and would go with the more popular one among the members as well as the one his heart wished for on occasions when there is a tie  In the end, it was a baby fox who was chosen as the winner  In another similar world cup, the battle between two very random options struck it out as the group chose their pick 

Jimin
The last member to display his unique skills was Jimin who began a food broadcast, also known as mukbang  He grabbed some yummy-looking pizza and the others revelled in the delicious food on his table  They asked him to mix various sauces and dip the fried chicken in them  The funniest part of the episode came when Jin grabbed Jimin&rsquo;s device and began commenting hilariously  A jelly-fried egg later, it was sure that this would be a treat not just for the eyes but for the ears as the BTS member put in an ASMR twist to it, earning shrieks of disgust in return  They all replied with funny-looking photos expressing their fake anger

"2022 came to a celebratory end for BTS, especially member J-Hope, who was in New York, making another fabulous display of his skills  While away from the members, he seemed to have enjoyed it to the fullest with a solo performance at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve where he did a live stage of 3 songs, solo track &lsquo;= (Equal Sign)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Chicken Noodle Soup&rsquo; his collaboration track with Becky G, and BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;Butter&rsquo; (Holiday Remix)  He officially became only the second South Korean soloist to perform at the event, following PSY  This was also J-Hope&rsquo;s third time at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve after group stages with BTS in 2017 and 2019 

J-Hope&rsquo;s live

After returning from Times Square where he performed as the penultimate act alongside multiple other singers from around the world and spoke to Ryan Seacrest, the host of the show, J-Hope was back at his hotel room and turned on a live broadcast to speak with his fans  As they congratulated him on his sparkling performance, being the perfectionist that he is, J-Hope expressed his sadness about being unable to use his voice to the fullest and talked about the slipping incident due to the rainy weather during his rehearsal stage &nbsp;

J-Hope on other BTS members&rsquo; New Year wishes

As soon as it turned 12, and the New Year began in South Korea, BTS members Jungkook, Jimin, and V took to the fan community platform Weverse to share their wishes with the fans as well as discuss their plans for the coming year  Jungkook and V kept it brief, wishing for a successful and happy year ahead while Jimin wrote a big letter to his fans about the feelings he had seemingly bottled for a long time about his wishes to release new music soon for which he has been meeting up with composers 

Thousands of miles away, member J-Hope was his cheeky self as he unleashed all his love for his fellow BTS members  He began commenting &lsquo;love you&rsquo; on their posts with cute words and received laughs from them in return 

Jin&rsquo;s call to J-Hope

On being asked about BTS&rsquo; oldest member Jin who became the first from the group to enlist in the military on December 13, J-Hope recalled how he was called by the member with a different phone number and almost missed it  J-Hope said, &ldquo;Right before I was about to sleep on the 31st, I got a call from Jin and asked him how he was doing to which he said J-Hope, pick up your phone  I told him I did not know this number, how would I know it was his?&rdquo;

The &lsquo;Arson&rsquo; hitmaker spoke with a smile on his face about how he felt happy hearing Jin&rsquo;s voice  It comforted him and J-Hope mentioned how he remembered all those moments he spent with Jin  He assured the fans by saying that Jin seemed to be healthy and doing well in the military  So in place of Jin, he shared that he was well and asked the fans to not worry  The lovely duo, BTS&rsquo; Jin and J-Hope nicknamed 2seok have always&nbsp;lightened the fans&rsquo; hearts with this interaction 
https://twitter com/nightstar1201/status/1609428759454822401Jimin X Taeyang

BTS member Jimin and BIGBANG member Taeyang are a collaboration nobody would have expected  However, in December 2022, it was reported by industry officials that the two are working together on a release that will soon be revealed to the world  To this, Taeyang&rsquo;s then-agency, YG Entertainment, which he has since departed, replied by saying that they cannot confirm anything at the moment and asked fans to anticipate Taeyang&rsquo;s activities &nbsp;

On January 1, Taeyang who is currently a free agent, not having signed with anyone for his solo activities as he continues to be with YG Entertainment for any content related to BIGBANG, shared a rare update on his Instagram account  2 photos were shared with a caption of the hashtag #2023  In black and white, 2 people could be seen in the photos, their backs to the camera  While one could easily be spotted as Taeyang himself, the other one was not tagged &nbsp;

                                                                                    
                                                                                Fans went into action and soon began investigating every detail of the photo  The other person seemed to be Jimin, as his hands, fluffy hair, and earrings seem to match the BTS member  Though no official announcement was made from either side, it seems that the singers have decided to give a green signal from their ends  Taeyang is rumoured to have been preparing for a January 2023 comeback so it seems as though we can expect the reports any time now  Once confirmed, this could very well be the biggest release of the year and one of the most hyped collaborations in K-pop history!

Meanwhile, BIGBANG&rsquo;s G-Dragon also announced that he is working on an album and hopes to release it in 2023

I told him I did not know this number, how would I know it was his?&rdquo;

The &lsquo;Arson&rsquo; hitmaker spoke with a smile on his face about how he felt happy hearing Jin&rsquo;s voice.  Jungkook and V kept it brief, wishing for a successful and happy year ahead while Jimin wrote a big letter to his fans about the feelings he had seemingly bottled for a long time about his wishes to release new music soon for which he has been meeting up with composers 

Thousands of miles away, member J-Hope was his cheeky self as he unleashed all his love for his fellow BTS members.  Once confirmed, this could very well be the biggest release of the year and one of the most hyped collaborations in K-pop history!

Meanwhile, BIGBANG&rsquo;s G-Dragon also announced that he is working on an album and hopes to release it in 2023

BTS member Jimin and BIGBANG member Taeyang are a collaboration nobody would have expected.  This was also J-Hope&rsquo;s third time at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve after group stages with BTS in 2017 and 2019 

J-Hope&rsquo;s live

After returning from Times Square where he performed as the penultimate act alongside multiple other singers from around the world and spoke to Ryan Seacrest, the host of the show, J-Hope was back at his hotel room and turned on a live broadcast to speak with his fans.  To this, Taeyang&rsquo;s then-agency, YG Entertainment, which he has since departed, replied by saying that they cannot confirm anything at the moment and asked fans to anticipate Taeyang&rsquo;s activities.  While away from the members, he seemed to have enjoyed it to the fullest with a solo performance at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve where he did a live stage of 3 songs, solo track &lsquo;= (Equal Sign)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Chicken Noodle Soup&rsquo; his collaboration track with Becky G, and BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;Butter&rsquo; (Holiday Remix)","2 photos were shared with a caption of the hashtag #2023.  Fans went into action and soon began investigating every detail of the photo.  He assured the fans by saying that Jin seemed to be healthy and doing well in the military.  He officially became only the second South Korean soloist to perform at the event, following PSY.  However, in December 2022, it was reported by industry officials that the two are working together on a release that will soon be revealed to the world.  In black and white, 2 people could be seen in the photos, their backs to the camera.  It comforted him and J-Hope mentioned how he remembered all those moments he spent with Jin.  J-Hope said, &ldquo;Right before I was about to sleep on the 31st, I got a call from Jin and asked him how he was doing to which he said J-Hope, pick up your phone.  So in place of Jin, he shared that he was well and asked the fans to not worry.  Taeyang is rumoured to have been preparing for a January 2023 comeback so it seems as though we can expect the reports any time now.  The other person seemed to be Jimin, as his hands, fluffy hair, and earrings seem to match the BTS member.  Though no official announcement was made from either side, it seems that the singers have decided to give a green signal from their ends.  While one could easily be spotted as Taeyang himself, the other one was not tagged. 2022 came to a celebratory end for BTS, especially member J-Hope, who was in New York, making another fabulous display of his skills",7.6237863682181,2023-01-02T14:33:16Z,3,15

"On January 2nd at 6 PM KST (2:30 PM IST), NewJeans&#39; single album and MV &#39;OMG&#39; was released  &#39;OMG&#39; deals with the story of a strange sense of distance, caution, and unfamiliarity that coexist on the side of the desire to get closer to each other  s a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&amp;B song that mixes &#39;UK garage&#39; rhythm and trap rhythm based on hip-hop drum source and percussion 

OMG:

This song expresses NewJeans&#39; unique and trendy tone in various styles, and it is expected that you will be able to feel another personality and charm of NewJeans  It is also expected to present a completely different feeling from the debut album &#39;NewJeans&#39; released last summer  NewJeans is one of the representative 4th generation girl groups that made the second half of 2022 hot with their debut  In a short period of time, not only did all of the triple title songs such as &#39;Attention&#39;, &#39;Cookie&#39; and &#39;Hype Boy&#39; become hits, but also led to the cover dance craze, winning both the Rookie Award and the Grand Prize at the year-end awards ceremony  He boasted an unrivaled presence and charm 

NewJeans&#39; achievement:

In particular, it showed the &#39;retro&#39; concept properly  With styling and cover images reminiscent of the 1990s and early 2000s, they instantly caught the eye, establishing themselves as a girl group with a unique concept  Here, while focusing on the narrative of &#39;relationship&#39;, the music video with an interesting story received a lot of attention  The chorus that is easy to sing along with the lyrics that resonate with, the addictive melody, and the attractive choreography were also points  As a result, content such as challenges, cover songs, and cover dances naturally increased &nbsp;

Ditto:

The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; attracted attention as soon as it was released with Park Ji Hu and Choi Hyun Wook&#39;s appearances and the retro sensibility of the video  In this way, New Jeans has already captured not only the topic but also the music charts in a short period of time  If last summer was refreshing NewJeans, this hip-hop R&amp;B &#39;OMG&#39; is expected to show a hip yet dreamy NewJeans 

NewJeans:

The strengths of NewJeans, such as the retro concept to believe in and watch, the narrative music video that is tightly packed with the keyword &#39;relationship&#39;, the content that makes you more immersed, the beautiful visuals of the members, the ability to blend these concepts perfectly, and the addictive yet attractive song  The number of pre-orders for NewJeans&#39; &#39;OMG&#39; this time exceeded 800,000 copies, surpassing the pre-order amount of the debut album and the total sales volume  The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; took first place on various music charts upon its release, and is still receiving a lot of love 
_ZAgIHmHLdcHere are five reasons why this song and MV had us gripping our seats:-&nbsp;

Song

The title song &#39;OMG&#39;, which was released following the pre-release song released at the end of the year, is a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&amp;B song that mixes UK garage rhythm and trap rhythm based on hip-hop drum source and percussion  In particular, the fact that the song was conceived during the production of the debut album also arouses interest  Member Hanni participated in writing the lyrics, and one can feel another charm of NewJeans by expressing their unique and trendy tone in various styles 

Concept&nbsp;

NewJeans have made a name for themselves from their debut time as one of the most unique K-Pop groups to exist as they break the stereotypes and the mold presented to them by the predecessors and rather, pave a new way of creating music as well as the MV  The MV is set in a mental facility where the five members express their issues and who they see themselves as  While it can seem quirky and funny, it is actually an inside view on how intense feelings can alter you as a person &nbsp;

The members&nbsp;

In the MV, each member has a different problem  Hanni thinks she is Siri, iPhone&rsquo;s built-in, voice controlled personal assistant, Danielle was found laughing at a TV with static but she is actually the person who thinks they are being controlled and tries to make the members remember that they are, in fact, NewJeans  It seems like Hyein has &lsquo;main character syndrome&rsquo; where she takes the role of the main character in her favorite fairy tales like Cinderella, Matchstick girl and Snow White while Haerin thinks she is a cat and is seen in many scenes, behaving like one  But the most twisted one is Minji&rsquo;s, who pretends to be a doctor taking all the other members to the facility while she, herself, suffers through issues &nbsp;

The message&nbsp;

The song talks about being lovesick and how those intense feelings make one go crazy and that is what shows in the MV as well  The idea of being meta in the MV also adds a nice flair to it  The idea of being in a relationship and expressing the struggles of being in one in this day and age is amazingly executed &nbsp;

References&nbsp;

The MV is packed with references  First, the choreography for OMG was initially shown to the viewers in Ditto and other scenes from that MV also makes its way like the gray cat represents Haerin  Kim Joo Hun of Big Mouth fame makes an appearance as the doctor who eventually becomes overwhelmed with all the stories he heard but the end scene is truly the cherry on top when a girl is shown writing hate comments about NewJeans and Minji appears as the doctor, taking her away &nbsp;

Mood Sampler 1:

In particular, this video was directed by V as a film director and perfectly reflected V&#39;s intention that &quot;I think classics are destined to come back to classics again &quot; &#39;Mood Sampler #1&#39; was held in the background of a garden with trumpets and birdsong and a window with sunlight shining through  When we saw V with neat and deep eyes through the leaves, the true beauty &#39;Veautiful&#39; unfolded  V&#39;s profile as he gazes at the leaves is a perfect beauty like a statue made by a sculptor with all his might, and his eyes contain a sense of nostalgia  It took his breath away when he saw V&#39;s delicate and graceful side profile while hearing only the sound of birdsong and turning the pages, as calm and slow as a slowly swinging antique pocket watch 

Dressed in a blue suit and white ribbon, V appeared in a classic, trendy, and unrealistic look at the same time  &quot;He proved what he said  The scene where V looks at the camera with a languid and dreamy gaze with his hands on his face under the sunlight at the window reminds me of an aristocratic young man in a classic British movie and completes all the fantasies of those who dream of romance 

Mood Sampler 2:

When &#39;Mood Sampler #2&#39; started, a romantic video of wild flowers placed on a white bedclothes came out  The appearance of V running with a flower in his mouth while looking up at the sky gave viewers a dazzling and colorful charm that goes back and forth between defenseless boyishness and bewitching beauty, making viewers fall in love

"Run BTS has been a place of comfort and respite to the fans of BTS who look forward to the group&rsquo;s goofy and human-like sides as they take a break from their usual superstar activities to play around  While a regular edition of the show has ended, the group often returns between their busy schedules and headline-making promotions to be their usual selves in special episodes aired every now and then 

RUN BTS TV On-air
A preview of the new episode showed the BTS members taking on the roles of live broadcasters which have become relatively common as more and more people seek a career in content creation  As the seven members, each took on their own specialities to become someone else for a day, their personalities were very visible  While one presented, the other six became the viewers and took on the job of communicating through comments only  Here&rsquo;s what went down with each of them 

Jungkook

While the youngest has often admitted to a lack of patience as he tries to learn things, he makes up for it by being good at all these activities right from the get-go  Jungkook has been interested in learning an instrument and it was the perfect fit as the BTS ARMY fulfilled their wish of seeing a rock-inspired Golden Maknae with this Run BTS episode  He took in-person lessons from a popular YouTuber &lsquo;Boogie Drum&rsquo; who taught the BTS member Butter on the drums  A super-focused Jungkook became the bane for the viewers aka BTS who bombarded his comments section with demands 

SUGA

The star rapper and producer promised to be more communicative and did just that as he picked up a brush instead of a guitar or a piano as most would have expected  SUGA began taking requests and the BTS member obliged with hilarious options  He finally decided to draw an egg and they kept calling him out for the lack of visibility and commented unfiltered making the painter lose his patience with them eventually, creating an even more comic scene  His attempt at drawing spicy noodles was funnier, even more so for the ones watching 

Jin
The BTS member has been known to spend a lot of time inside the comfort of his house playing away on his computer  Jin was given three games to try out and he began with a difficult-to-control skateboard game that he ended after flipping it twice  Next was an annoyingly difficult game for Jin whose secrets were unknown to others  Trying his best to control his emotions he tried his best but soon gave up  Onto the last game, a trick awaited in the form of horror as a round designed to fool the player was set up  The end was just as funny for the BTS member who was left alone as all the viewers but one left his chat room not letting him say goodbye  SUGA stayed back to support Jin and it was the most heartwarming moment of the episode 

J-Hope
A brief look at J-Hope&rsquo;s broadcast revealed him trying fun toys while the other BTS members cosplayed as kids  What will explode in this live? Part 2 will be released next week!

They were assigned tasks while they also fought their fears- the zombies.  They won coupons and did their best for more cackles

"BTS consists of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook&mdash;co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single Mic Drop, as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).&nbsp;

BTS&#39; achievements:&nbsp;

BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966&ndash;1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite.

""Chan's Room"" has now become a comfort place for me and I would be lying if I say I do not wait for the weekends for those ""big hugs"". If I had to name one thing that I learned from you then that would be ""kindness"". The way you genuinely care for every single individual around you, make them feel comfortable and most importantly put them before yourself, not only shows your big heart but also how compassionate you are as a person. From encouraging us to be proud of the little demon that resides within us to comforting us by saying it's okay to cry and let it out to giving tips on how to deal with stress and anxiety, you've truly been a Guardian angel for us Stays. Honestly, I could go on talking about how much your kindness has given me the strength to endure these hard times, not just me but Stays and every other person who looks up to you. I truly hope that the next time you take a Buzzfeed quiz, the answer to ""Do you love yourself?"" would be a genuine YES accompanied with that dimpled smile.

We look forward to supporting iKON&#39;s activities in various fields in the future.  We would also like to thank iKONIC who have been with us for iKON&rsquo;s journey.  What I can say is that our contracts with the members have not ended yet.  While Daesung moved to THEBLACKLABEL, a subsidiary of YG Entertainment which was co-founded by Teddy, Taeyang will only associate with the agency for BIGBANG promotions.  iKON&rsquo;s promotions will continue under the management of YG Entertainment, though their exclusive contract has ended.

"BTS X Snoop Dogg and Benny Blanco's Bad Decisions's music video and the song is out! And the Bad Decisions MV is different from the rest of the BTS music videos. BTS' vocal line - Jin aka Kim Seokjin, Jimin aka Park Jimin, Taehyung aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook aka Jeon Jungkook - are collaborating with Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg for the first time for a pop number. While the song is quite catchy and easy to groove on to, it seems BTS ARMY is not that happy with the MV. There are mixed reactions to BTS X Bad Decisions ft Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg So, the Bad Decisions' MV (music video) features Benny Blanco as a fan of BTS, a BT ARMY. He is looking forward to attending the concert of the Bangtan Boys. He has his whole bedroom full of BTS's merch, pictures, postcards, posters, etc. The video features Benny Blanco getting ready for the concert. He dresses up in purple, makes a purple placard for cheering on the boys, and bakes a purple cake to take to the stadium. However, he gets stuck in the traffic. The cake gets destroyed and Benny Blanco is seen running off to the stadium where he is stopped by the security person who reveals to him that he is  28 hours early. He tries to negotiate with the security saying that he wants to have the best seat. The security man drives him off saying that it's assigned seating. In the end, Benny Blanco is seen sitting outside the gate waiting for the BTS concert to happen instead of going home. Snoop Dogg makes appearances in between too and he's good Well, BTS ARMY is having a mixed reaction to the music video of Bad Decisions ft Benny Blanco and Snoop Dogg while Jungkook, Jimin, Taehyung and Jin have provided vocals to the song.

He dresses up in purple, makes a purple placard for cheering on the boys, and bakes a purple cake to take to the stadium.  He has his whole bedroom full of BTS's merch, pictures, postcards, posters, etc.  He is looking forward to attending the concert of the Bangtan Boys.

He also taunted her for liking a group of musicians who wear lipstick and makeup to dance on stage BTS fans aka ARMY from India has been sharing the video on all platforms. This has also been covered in the Korean media. Several people have called out the professor saying that he could have corrected the student in a better manner.

"BTS is famous for breaking boundaries and creating bonds with Dynamite songs on your Sweet Night as well as your crying time at Zero O&#39;Clock  BTS had taken the inspirational (Live, Laugh, Love) to a whole new artistic and poetic level  According to Korea Herald, they are the only band since The Beatles to have two No 1 albums in less than a year  And the Bangtan Boys do it while slaying banger choreography  They are relentless at making fans their priority, as there is hardly a time we see BTS not working &nbsp;

Who are BTS?

Bangtan Boys, popularly known as BTS, are the most famous boy band in South Korea  Formed in 2010, when they are not creating music or writing their own lyrics, they are improving the country&rsquo;s GDP  According to Entrepreneur, they single-handedly helped produce 0 30% of the country&rsquo;s output  Reaching beyond the boundaries of South Korea, BTS is a global sensation, appearing in many Hollywood talk shows hosted by Ellen, Jimmy Fallon, and many more &nbsp;
The 7 bandmates as well as horsemen of BTS include Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook 

The lyricism of BTS is well-known  From philosophy to self-love, BTS has it all covered in melody 

So, let&rsquo;s look at 10 quotes by BTS you can metaphorically hug to sleep this winter -

1  &nbsp;When RM strikes a chord, again

&quot;I&#39;ve had to accept that - that everyone cannot love me  Because when there&#39;s love, there&#39;s hate  When there&#39;s light, there&#39;s dark  But it was really hard to accept as an artist that there&#39;s a lot of people that hate me, but on the other side, there are many more people who love me  I think everyone goes through that&rdquo; - RM (via Seventeen Magazine)

This is probably the most heartfelt quote made by the leader RM and it resonated with many &nbsp;

2  Quickly rkive-ing quotes to live by

&quot;We&rsquo;re on some path that&rsquo;s set since we&rsquo;re born, but I still believe we can change some things  So I believe in my faith but I still don&rsquo;t believe in my fate &quot;- RM

If this doesn&rsquo;t give Perks of Being a Wallflower Charlie then what does?

3  Feels like a hug

&nbsp;&ldquo;I really want to say that everyone in the world is lonely and everyone is sad, and if we know that everyone is suffering and lonely, I hope we can create an environment where we can ask for help and say things are hard when they&rsquo;re hard and say that we miss someone when we miss them &rdquo;- Suga

No words, just feelings &nbsp;

4  Cookie to Jungkookie

&quot;Effort makes you  You will regret someday if you don&rsquo;t do your best now  Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too late but keep working on it  It takes time, but there&rsquo;s nothing that gets worse due to practicing  So practice  You may get depressed, but it&rsquo;s evidence that you are doing good&quot;- Jungkook

Give a cookie to Jungkookie for turning that hustle mode on &nbsp;

5  The lyrics of Zero O&rsquo;Clock make sense now

&ldquo;If any of you feels lost in the face of uncertainty or the pressure of starting anew, don&rsquo;t rush  Take a deep breath  You may find that any moment can be turned into opportunity &rdquo;- Jin

The lyrics of Zero O&rsquo;Clock &ldquo;Will something be different?/ It won&#39;t be something like that/ But this/ day will be over/ When the minute and second hands overlap/ The world holds its breath for a little while/ Zero o&#39;clock&rdquo; is actually written by Jin and it all makes sense now 

6  Trust the process

&ldquo;I feel like I live with a sense of mission  Rather than thinking, It has to be perfect! I do what I have to do, making sure I remember the really important and fundamental things and trust that the results will follow &rdquo;- J-Hope

The true philosopher of the lot &nbsp;

7  It&rsquo;s okay to be not okay

&ldquo;We are all in different parts of the world, in different environments and circumstances, but at this moment, I hope we can all give each other a warm pat on the back and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s okay &rsquo;&rdquo;- Jimin

BTS don&rsquo;t sympathize, they empathize with the youth &nbsp;

8  Pause this moment

&ldquo;When things get hard, stop for awhile and look back and see how far you&rsquo;ve come  Don&rsquo;t forget how rewarding it is  You are the most beautiful flower, more than anyone else in this world&rdquo; - V

This quote is for times when like Chris from Into The Wild, you need to feel strong more than actually being strong &nbsp;

9  &nbsp;When you need a mantra to chant every morning

&quot;You do need to study, but don&rsquo;t suffer due to it  Because you might miss what you want to do because of it  You need to make your own dream  It&rsquo;s heartbreaking if you&rsquo;re forced by others &rdquo; - Jungkook

This is your daily reminder to not quit and keep on believing &nbsp;

10  Inspiration for weekdays

&ldquo;Life is tough and things don&rsquo;t always work out well, but we should be brave and go on with our lives &rdquo; - Suga

Here is a little bit of Suga-ry thoughts to end your days with &nbsp;

This is probably the most heartfelt quote made by the leader RM and it resonated with many.  It takes time, but there&rsquo;s nothing that gets worse due to practicing.  It&rsquo;s heartbreaking if you&rsquo;re forced by others &rdquo; - Jungkook

This is your daily reminder to not quit and keep on believing.  Pause this moment

&ldquo;When things get hard, stop for awhile and look back and see how far you&rsquo;ve come.  Quickly rkive-ing quotes to live by

&quot;We&rsquo;re on some path that&rsquo;s set since we&rsquo;re born, but I still believe we can change some things.  Reaching beyond the boundaries of South Korea, BTS is a global sensation, appearing in many Hollywood talk shows hosted by Ellen, Jimmy Fallon, and many more.  So I believe in my faith but I still don&rsquo;t believe in my fate &quot;- RM

If this doesn&rsquo;t give Perks of Being a Wallflower Charlie then what does?

3.  So practice.  Take a deep breath.  The lyrics of Zero O&rsquo;Clock make sense now

&ldquo;If any of you feels lost in the face of uncertainty or the pressure of starting anew, don&rsquo;t rush.  They are relentless at making fans their priority, as there is hardly a time we see BTS not working.  Trust the process

&ldquo;I feel like I live with a sense of mission.  When there&#39;s light, there&#39;s dark.  You are the most beautiful flower, more than anyone else in this world&rdquo; - V

This quote is for times when like Chris from Into The Wild, you need to feel strong more than actually being strong.  You may get depressed, but it&rsquo;s evidence that you are doing good&quot;- Jungkook

Give a cookie to Jungkookie for turning that hustle mode on.  You need to make your own dream.  You will regret someday if you don&rsquo;t do your best now. BTS is famous for breaking boundaries and creating bonds with Dynamite songs on your Sweet Night as well as your crying time at Zero O&#39;Clock",6.623768899694394,2023-01-03T18:41:33Z,3,13

"Whether it is BTS or SEVENTEEN, both the K-pop groups have loyal and protective fans. In fact, both are under HYBE. SEVENTEEN has been touring in North America to packed audiences. The 13 member group is known for their talent in music production. In fact, other than BTS they are one of the most successful boy groups around. An American channel interviewed them and asked Seventeen if they imagined that they would be as successful as BTS when they made their debut. Now, BTS made their debut in 2013 while Seventeen made their entry in 2015. Both the groups have members who are passionate about music production Seventeen gave an interview to the channel Sirius XM and the interviewer asked them, ""When you started the band, there’s no way you expected that you’d be up there just like BTS. That you’d be at the same level as BTS."" Vernon aka Choi Hansol who was taking most of the questions replied in a very mature and graceful manner. He said, ""When we debuted, BTS wasn’t the BTS today either. So, it’s really crazy what we’re doing right now and where we are at right now."" He is not factually incorrect. BTS started making headlines in the West after 2016. Moreover, the comparison question was totally uncalled for. Both the groups are super talented and passionate as performers However, some sections of ARMY and Carats are dragging the issue on social media. The former feels that Vernon could have shown some more respect to BTS who are their seniors. Carats feel Vernon was right in his own way. Neutral fans feel that BTS members are pals with Seventeen so there is no need to diss one another. Take a look at the tweets Vernon aka Choi Hansol is a Korean-American rapper. He was born in New York but moved to Korea as a kid. He is half Korean and half Caucasian. Seventeen is one of the most acclaimed groups like BTS in K-Pop","Both the groups are super talented and passionate as performers However, some sections of ARMY and Carats are dragging the issue on social media.

BIGHIT MUSIC has focused to the milestone moment when it would be possible to respect the needs of the country and for these healthy young men to serve with their countrymen, and that’s now.  Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment With the release of their first anthology album earlier this year it opened the path to allow the members to take some time to explore individual projects.  Group member Jin will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his solo release is concluded at the end of October.  He will then follow the enlistment procedure of the Korean government.  In a statement, the music company said Jin will begin his process as early as October end.  Kim Seok-jin, BTS’ oldest member, is required to join the army after he turns 30 on Dec 4, and the second-oldest member Min Yoon-ki is due to be enlisted in 2024 under a revised law.  Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own individual plans.  Others will join as as and when they are asked.  Some polls show a majority of South Koreans, not just the group’s dedicated fans who are known as Army, think the group’s members should be allowed exemptions from, or be offered some alternative to, military duties Military service exemptions, however, are controversial in a country where inequality and privilege are highly touchy subjects. HYBE has confirmed that all members of hit band BTS will join military service",7.628505475678878,2022-10-17T07:00:00Z,2,1

"BTS and tales of their sasaeng fans are well-known. Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival.

"Balming Tiger was fresh off of a live reaction, the first from them, for the SEXY NUKIM music video feat  RM of BTS, however, our pile of questions awaited, and kind as ever the seven of them were ready to answer them all 

Alternative K-pop band
Standing out from the rest, Balming Tiger defined themselves as “A Multi-National Alternative K-pop band and Asian Arts & Culture Collective ” On asking, the group uncovered the very reason they decided to use Alternative K-pop as their genre- they wished to be free from the shackles of set norms and put themselves under an umbrella that would allow them to continue making music of all kinds  Genius, we think 

Growing influence
Balming Tiger is very well aware of the millions riding Hallyu and in this storm of interest, they wish to make themselves and others like them constants in world music  Their goal? Longevity in the influence of Korean culture  And to take a step in the right direction, they brought in inarguably one of the most crucial elements characteristically anchoring the Korean wave - BTS - and worked with leader RM to be able to reach a wider audience and they’ve done just that as the song rocked atop multiple music charts 

Working with other artists
Collaborations come very naturally to the group, whose Omega Sapien shared the details of his solo work ‘Wrecker’ with SEVENTEEN’s Vernon  They’ve been friends for a while and a random meeting saw him suggest the idea to the same-aged K-pop star who happily agreed to be a part of the release 

On the other hand, roping in RM may not have been a tough mountain to climb either, as the collective’s leader, San Yawn, rubbed elbows with the very acclaimed producer, Supreme Boi, who has been credited for superhit tracks like ‘Dionysus’ and ‘Idol’ by BTS, and ‘Cat & Dog (English Version)’ by TOMORROW X TOGETHER, to name a few  San Yawn and Supreme Boi belong to the same alumnus that both decided to drop out of, a fact we cheered about during our talk  They’re both doing fabulously well, after all 

Their charm
Balming Tiger is not unknown to the Korean crowd who have previously grooved to their domestically viral release ‘Kolo Kolo’, which also happens to be our personal favourite  One look at their discography and you can easily notice that they’re quirky, full of ideas and oozing with talent- a part of which the unversed were able to witness through SEXY NUKIM 

During our conversation, the group dished about the many secret details of their collaborative song- how it was to be shot in another country originally, how they reacted to RM’s first try on his SEXY NUKIM verse, how different each of their experiences was while shooting the music video and how they acknowledge that this is only the start for them 

Over an hour of deep conversations, laughs and cultural exchange later- the collective was ready to hop on the plane for their show the next morning and we parted ways with their fascination about us deciding to “입덕” (ipdeok) aka stan them!

Hardly, it was very natural, just like their collaborations

"One of the best things about today&#39;s generation is that they are vocal about mental health, want to learn about it, and want to spread awareness about it  Now, this is a super important and sensitive subject considering how severe the impacts of ill mental health can be, especially if you are working in the entertainment industry and have to fit certain criteria every time you are in front of the camera 

&nbsp;

With their polished makeup, constant media attention, glitzy outfits, extreme diets, well-curated social media feeds, pressure to perform, and millions of adoring fans - it becomes difficult to see our favored K-pop celebs as one of us, regular humans  More often than not, we viewers idolize our on-screen K-pop stars and look up to them  And the topics of mental health, personal struggles, and illnesses are not something that is often discussed in the K-pop industry 

&nbsp;

So, their opening up about their mental health struggles is equally brave and an eye-opener for all their followers  Not only do our favorite K-pop idols reveal the harsh reality of being in front of the camera 24*7, but they also tell the world that no one battling depression, anxiety, or any other form of mental illness is alone! We are there to support you, we believe in you, and most importantly, we care about you - there is no shame in seeking help or talking about your mental health struggles  On the contrary, our K-pop idols encourage us to open up about our mental health battles just like they do - be it in the form of their songs or in their candid interviews 

&nbsp;

So, today we will talk about some of your beloved K-pop idols who spoke about their mental health, the impact, and how they dealt with it 

&nbsp;

Once again, please remember that you are not alone (hugs) 

&nbsp;

(Trigger Warning&nbsp;-&nbsp;This article contains references to mental illness, mental health struggles, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and suicide )

&nbsp;

23 beloved K-pop idols who spoke about their mental health

&nbsp;

SUGA (BTS)
One of the strongest voices within the Korean music industry backing mental health is the 29-year-old rapper SUGA  He has frequently spoken up about his battles with depression, social anxiety, and OCD while offering condolence to his fans worldwide who feel alone in their mental battles 

The BTS member opened up about his mental struggles back in 2016 when he released Agust D, his first mixtape  In that mixtape, he built an alter-ego who resisted all societal expectations but had a vulnerability that allowed him to rift the topic of mental health 

In Agust D, SUGA raps,

&nbsp;

&quot;On the other side of the famous idol rapper

Stands my weak self, it&rsquo;s a bit dangerous

Depression, OCD

They keep coming back again from time to time &quot;

&nbsp;

Once again, in May 2021, in an interview with Rolling Stone, SUGA explained his mental health as cold weather wherein negative emotions come and go  He added that people must be encouraged to share their mental health struggles, rather than silently suffering and keeping it to themselves 

&nbsp;

This BTS member has often used music and songs like The Last to look introspectively and address the depression and anxiety that he faces 

He has also openly spoken about mental health disorders during many interviews  In one such interview, Suga stated, &quot;loneliness and anxiety stay forever  How you choose to make peace with them needs a lifetime of contemplation &quot;

&nbsp;

RM (BTS)
BTS members have never shied away from openly speaking about rough and sensitive issues that the youths of today face 

So, when RM fans questioned him about his well-being - when he hosted a live broadcast to celebrate his 27th birthday on 12 September - he replied, &quot;every day is a fight to not lose to depression and not giving up &quot;

&nbsp;

We, as his fans and followers, are pleased to see that he spoke about his mental well-being and is making time for activities, like cleaning his room, exercising, and watering plants, that support his physical as well as mental health 

&nbsp;

Bae Suzy (Miss A)
Bae Suzy has been in the public eye ever since the debut of Miss A in 2010  She was merely 15 years old when she was thrust into fame  While being an actor and K-pop idol got her stardom, she was beyond stressed and battled depression during the initial years of her career 

&nbsp;

Juggling between Miss A&#39;s promotions and her acting projects, Suzy was pushed to the brink and even burst into tears in front of her close friend  She spoke about her mental health struggles during a talk show, Healing Camp, on SBS  She even blatantly called out to people who forgot that she was merely a child 

&nbsp;

The former member of Miss A appears to be doing considerably better and also released an English number, Cape, which is the perspective of being someone&#39;s aid as they steer through their mental health issues 

&nbsp;

Kang Daniel
Kang Daniel, the former member of Wanna One, has always been honest about his battles with mental illness  Not only has he been vocal about it, but he even based an entire album, Yellow, around this subject  This album included songs like Paranoia and Antidote and was released in April 2021  The songs were a reference to the three-month-long break that he took in November 2019 to focus on his mental well-being after dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic disorders  Fortunately, this much-needed break seemed to help him with how he felt about himself and the industry (in general), and he definitely returned feeling much stronger and better!

&nbsp;

In an interview with NME, Kang Daniel stated,

&quot;I don&rsquo;t think I have changed, but I feel like there has been a change  I still read bad comments, but because I was able to overcome them once, I can just deal with them now  There is a certain way to do that, and I trust myself and the people around me to help me  There are good days and bad days, but there is always a reason to live  There are good things about life, and that is what I look for now &quot;

&nbsp;

Jeongyeon (Twice)

&nbsp;

He took to Twitter to express himself and stated,

&quot;There was a point where I really had a hard time, but I met a good teacher  I draw, it&#39;s called art therapy, it&#39;s healing your mind through drawing, and I met a teacher who helps people who have hard times, they became a great help in my life  What is hard is that I am an adult encountering society and looking for a way to handle it, but since I&#39;m young and inexperienced  It&#39;s as if I put my hand here, and it hurts like hell, but (there is no) way  So when I was like that, the teacher guided me well, and I became the person that I am today with the thoughts I have right now &quot;

With their polished makeup, constant media attention, glitzy outfits, extreme diets, well-curated social media feeds, pressure to perform, and millions of adoring fans - it becomes difficult to see our favored K-pop celebs as one of us, regular humans.

Thankfully, his fans quickly sent their support and showered him with their love at the time.  Moreover, she even had to follow an extreme diet (dubbed the IU diet) to lose weight (as per Korean beauty standards) for an acting project 

 

Although despite everything, she did not back down and spoke about her experiences in 2014 at SBS&#39; Healing Camp.

Goo Hara (Kara)
Kara&#39;s Goo Hara and Sulli were very close friends, and only a month after her death, news broke about Goo&rsquo;s death.  She was merely 15 years old when she was thrust into fame.  She was only a teenager when she debuted as a K-pop soloist (without having other people or members to lean on as in bands).

So when I was like that, the teacher guided me well, and I became the person that I am today with the thoughts I have right now &quot;

The leader of the band, SEVENTEEN, S Coups is one such example.  The songs were a reference to the three-month-long break that he took in November 2019 to focus on his mental well-being after dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic disorders.  There are good days and bad days, but there is always a reason to live.  There are good things about life, and that is what I look for now &quot;

Her response was hugely appreciated and appropriately critical.  This album included songs like Paranoia and Antidote and was released in April 2021.  This also unconsciously manifested as anxiety about her weight.  This gap even resulted in sparking rumors that she was leaving the group 

 

However, the agency waved away all such rumors and claimed that Yeonwoo was getting treatment for her mental condition of panic disorder.  Ultimately, she started to feel better, left her girl group, and started her solo career as a K-pop actress

"On August 28, 2022, BLACKPINK, the popular K-pop girl band, performed for the first time at the MTV Video Music Awards show in New Jersey  Although it was a merry-ride for the band&#39;s fandom known as BLINK, the popular magazine Variety called out the girl band and stated that they lip-synced the songs in their performance  Not only that, but the reputed magazine also called the musical group &quot;repeat offenders &quot; Check out the full story here!

"BTS members value their private lives immensely. RM aka Kim Namjoon is the one who shares a lot with ARMY. Fans get to see almost every art exhibit in Korea due to his Instagram. He also posts from his travels and trips in and across the world. But still he believes that there should be a boundary. BTS leader RM aka Kim Namjoon recently visited the famous Hwaemosa Temple of Korea. It is close to the Jirisan Mountain and has a complex of temples under the Jogye order of Buddhism. He had gone with his close friend, San Yawn of Balming Tiger. Fans might have seen him in the Sexy Nukim video Now, Korean media reported the details of the visit and said that he was in regular contact with one of the monks here. It seems he spent the night at the monastery soaking into the Buddhist culture. A couple of pics were also released of Namjoon and San Yawn sitting with the monks. It seems he met Venerable Deokmon of the temple. The global icon can be seen in a black hoodie. They are also reported that he donates 500 bags every year for kindergarten kids in the Philippines. Now, it looks like RM aka Kim Namjoon of BTS is not impressed with such detailed coverage of the place. He wrote that if things are meant to be low key then they should be kept low key on his Insta stories. He said he would visit some other temple next time around. In fact, he also deleted his Instagram posts from that visit In fact, people had begun speculating if he is a Buddhist or just interested in the philosophy after seeing the pics. The monks apparently said that he came to do some contemplation and seek inspiration for new music. ARMY is upset with how casually people disregard his requests It is a little disappointing given how Namjoon aka RM shares the most with fans. Maybe they should have asked him for consent at least. In fact, details of his conversation with the monk was also released. He was asked about his view on joining military service. It seems he said he should fulfill duty first and then ask for rights.

It seems that RM had a chat with the head monk about his upcoming enlistment who asked him about his feelings on not receiving military exemption and if he was sad  To this, the BTS leader is said to have replied with wise words saying that as a citizen of South Korea, he wishes to fulfil his duty and only then he will be able to speak about rights  He added that he would think of the experience as turning into an adult &nbsp;

The monk is said to have replied with considering a year and a half out of his 80 years life span as precious time to look back on and not a waste  Venerable Deokmun reportedly wished that BTS&#39; RM continues to make good music even when he becomes old, and added that he wished they would help others just as much love as BTS has received from global fans  He further continued that he hoped the group would become an existence that transcends music instead of someone that easily disappears &nbsp;

RM&rsquo;s signed copy of his recently released album &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; which was given to the head monk was also revealed through photos shared with the media 

RM&rsquo;s response

On January 5, BTS member RM took to his Instagram stories to react to the reports made about his visit  He seemingly called out the temple for publicizing his private visit as he wrote, &ldquo;I was grateful for the time spent there, but didn&rsquo;t expect an article about it&hellip;&rdquo; and added a laughing emoji to it  He made his plans clear for future visits which he would like to be private, saying &ldquo;Next time I&rsquo;ll quietly visit another temple &rdquo;
RM seemed unimpressed with the actions of the temple as he spoke about how he likes to move usually, which is low-key  He further made a very clear statement calling them out by hashtagging &ldquo;low key must be low key&rdquo; in his last Instagram story  The BTS member also removed his post with photos from his visit to the temple from his feed expressing his wishes 
RM visiting another art gallery

In different news, the BTS member recently made a stop at the Gyeongnam Museum of Art in Changwon to see the Lee Kunhee special exhibition  His attendance was only noted on following his visit and seeing the photos he shared on his Instagram  RM has become quite popular in the art industry for his interest in collecting pieces that are not only well-known but also the ones that he personally enjoys or finds meaning in  The officials of Gyeongnam Museum of Art said that they were unaware of his visit and believe that the singer quietly saw the exhibition and returned

"A faction of BTS ARMY can be very imaginative. As we know, there are a lot of theories on how Princess Diana reincarnated as Jungkook. She passed away on August 31, 1997 and as we know, Jungkook was born on September 1, 1997. Some fans have drawn many similarities between the popular princess and Jungkook like how their smiles look similar, and even shared pics of them in cardigans with matching prints. Yesterday, the Queen of England Elizabeth II passed away at the age of 96. It is a huge loss for Great Britain. The Queen had been active till old age, and was seen as a role model by many Yesterday, BTS also did a VLive for Chuseok, which is the three day festival of Korea. It is a harvest festival, and time when folks visit extended families and relatives. All the members were there but Jungkook was too sleepy. He said he had medicines for an allergy which could have made him drowsy. Some weird fans started off a conversation that he was possessed by the spirit of late Princess Diana on the day of the demise of the Queen Of England. The hashtag #Jungkook began trending under the topic of the royal family. This is how people reacted on the same But this has not impressed many including BTS ARMYs. They feel such a conversation has been started by someone who is a hater. The Queen of England held a special place in the hearts of UK citizens. Making such a theory on the day of her demise looks insensitive. As we know, a nation is in mourning. BTS has always conducted themselves with utmost dignity. Such conspiracy theories do not reflect well on the K-Pop kings","Some fans have drawn many similarities between the popular princess and Jungkook like how their smiles look similar, and even shared pics of them in cardigans with matching prints.

"Run BTS announced its first drop in the new year with a new version of the highly popular variety show that brings together one of the biggest acts of the planet in their most real and fun state  Titled &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, the teaser foreshadowed a group time with unlimited laughter incoming for the BTS ARMY 

Pizza time

Celebrity chef Paik Jong Won, who has previously worked with the South Korean group for another &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episode, has become friends with the members, especially the oldest, Jin  In fact, the chef and the singer decided to have their own short variety show named &lsquo;Drunken Truth&rsquo; where they handmade some alcohol  Paik Jong Won sent some delicious pizzas from his brand to the BTS members who devoured them 

V and Jungkook&rsquo;s predicament

While the hyungs were enjoying the pizza, the two youngest tried not to give in to their cravings  Sat beside each other, the maknaes were controlling their urge to grab a bite from the many tasty-looking slices while the older members lightly teased them about it  It became a fight against their own decisions as the two members were on diet and stuck to not caving into the wants  Jungkook even went ahead and held a slice right against V&rsquo;s nose just to see if he would be tempted but the &lsquo;Sweet Night&rsquo; singer stuck to his resolve &nbsp;

Jin&rsquo;s &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; toppings remark

The &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; hitmaker gobbled down the pizza and praised all the mouthwatering toppings as the other members agreed  However, there was one particular comment that made global fans do a double take  Jin raved about the pickles he was eating with his pizza and asked, &ldquo;How do people overseas eat pizza without pickles?&rdquo;  While many questioned his topping choices, others came to his defence saying that he meant radish pickles and not the cucumber ones trying to make the situation better, launching a hilarious discourse across social media about his pick 

The game of 16

BTS started light with a card game where they put their minds to test  Putting their matha and addition skills to test, SUGA was the first one out while the rest fought it out with numbers  Towards the end, as only members Jimin, Jin and RM stayed, the former&rsquo;s move made RM yell out &lsquo;Shibow&rsquo; (fifteen: shib means ten + ow meaning five) making everyone flustered as the pronunciation is too close to a Korean cuss word  They clarified the same amidst fits of laughter and disbelief  The first game&rsquo;s winner was Jimin, followed by the ranks in order: RM, Jin, J-Hope, V, Jungkook and SUGA, who came in last 

The &lsquo;Liar&rsquo; game

BTS played an upgraded version of the famed mafia game as they were divided into two teams in each round: the liar team and the citizens/villagers team  While they all tried their best to fool each other and find out who the actual liars are, it was only more apparent how well the BTS members knew each other and were accustomed to their presence  To add to the fun, each one of them was given electroencephalograph cat ears  As they lied or tried to be cheeky, the ears moved and made them look adorable  When a question about if they liked to take showers frequently or not was raised, they failed to lie and the liar team was found out easily  The next question was about them having fruity faces and though they faltered, it became a hilarious round of guessing who was which fruit  The last question was about dancing when sad and soon the fingers were pointed once again  In the end, the game came to a close with Jungkook being rightfully picked as the liar 

The following week&rsquo;s episode was teased next with more fun games at the expense of the BTS members who are always ready to unleash their funny sides  After the group events, it is time for solo games that will earn the members more points and hopefully, a reward awaits them at the end

The famed variety show was begun by the South Korean septet in 2015  It did not gain the numbers it currently boasts right off the bat as it first started slowly with smaller episodes that introduced the group member&rsquo;s traits to the world  Over time, their charms had the fans hoodwinked, and as the global influence, as well as their amount of fans, grew, so did the interest in their non-music activities, with the primary focus on &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  The show took a break of 10 months and returned late last year with special episodes released every few weeks to keep the momentum going

The leads

Lee Min Ho will take on the role of OB-GYN Gong Ryong who paid an exorbitant sum of money to fly to space as a tourist  Gong Hyo Jin will portray the accomplished astronaut captain Eve Kim, a stickler for accuracy who will not put up with any errors  We may infer from the plot of the drama that it will be a tale of hatred and love, with the lady taking on the tougher path  This is undoubtedly such a welcome change

A person also wrote, ""Jungkook smiling because his blazer button kept taking off I'm screaming ""A fan also tweeted, ""Not the entire fandom crossing fingers over that one button of Jungkook's shirt to get open "" ""Jungkook struggling with the buttons a never-ending saga,"" said a person.

At the back of it, it had three purple hearts.  BTS will also perform at the 2022 Grammy Awards.  Both side panic attacks,"" said a fan.  However, Jungkook and his struggle with his blazer button caught ARMY's eyes.  However, the button opened again and he was seen fixing it Taking to Twitter, ARMY wrote comments on the incident.  I think the day when you clap, scream, dance, play, get hydrated, go home to take a bath and sleep isn’t too far away ”BTS members will travel to the US for their April concert in Las Vegas.  I thought this was outdoor, but I guess it’s indoors? So that’s why we weren’t able to open the third floor but next time, we’ll fill it completely and fully.  Jin for the last day wore a hairband with the letters, 'ARMY' written on it.  On the last day of their home concert, ARMY was treated to We are Bulletproof: the Eternal, BLUE &amp; GREY, Fake Love, IDOL, Permission to Dance, among other tracks.  The concert had many special moments from the members singing Spring Day to scolding RM as he yawned on the stage.  The youngest BTS member kept on trying to fix the button and after a few tries succeeded.  They also made him reflect on his actions by making him raise his arms.  They are nominated in the best pop duo/group performance category for Butter at the Grammys.  They will perform in front of a live audience at the Allegiant Stadium on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16.  Though he didn't let the incident affect his performance, he was seen chuckling.  While some of the members had T-shirts under their jackets, Jimin and Jungkook opted for only the blazers At one point while dancing, Jungkook's blazer button popped open. BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook returned to the stage on Sunday on the final day of their Permission To Dance on Stage concert in Seoul",6.771044836977747,2022-03-13T08:00:00Z,2,10

Taeyang of BIGBANG just released two additional solo teaser visuals for his next digital single &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo;, which features Jimin of BTS  The monochromatic headshot photograph he shared yesterday perfectly captures the true intensity that the song might have  The slightly blurred effect gives us twisted aesthetics and a sensuous atmosphere, showcasing a strong and delicate emotion 

The second teaser photograph he shared today, in contrast, has a stunning aurora light effect that creates a sleek yet ethereal ambience  His chiselled jaw is highlighted by the side profile, and his unparalleled fierce charm is highlighted by the sideways cold glance

Back in 2013, right around the time of his debut with BTS, the idol had admitted that BIGBANG&rsquo;s Taeyang was the K-pop superstar he looked up to, revered the most, and had then hoped to perform together on the same stage! This endeavour is nothing less than Jimin&#39;s ultimate dream collaboration since he will be working with the guy who inspired him throughout his formative years in the business

"BTS members seem to be using Instagram as their new group chat. From discussing on meeting up for drinks to talks on strawberries, Instagram is now their go to place. BTS member SUGA aka Min Yoongi is not very active on Instagram. Make no mistake his posts get better engagement than others. Yesterday, he decided to make his debut with the comments section. He asked RM aka Kim Namjoon what size would he (SUGA) need to buy of the jogger pants. As we know, BTS HYBE merch is driving fans crazy. RM had designed jogger pants and a wind chime. The jogger pants are out of stock but we guess as a BTS member SUGA has his privileges RM told him that SUGA wore L while he was XL. In his second comment, RM said he could have asked this size related information on group chat rather than on Instagram. Needless to say, fans began discussing how the boys use Instagram as  group chat nowadays. Many were shocked to know that SUGA buys clothing in size L. Others pointed out that he has broad shoulders unlike other members. RM has buffed up immensely so it is not surprising that he needs XL. After all, most fans know him as 'Little Kitten' and 'Smol Bean' . Fans also reminisced about the time RM said that SUGA and he wore same size underwear. After living together for 11 years, they are as familiar to each other as husband and wife. In fact, RM had once said that if he did not like his impulsive buys he could easily pass them to SUGA as they wear same size ARMY cannot get over this #NamGi interaction. RM's idea to put this on Kakao Talk is perhaps because he guessed what kind of conversation it would inspires in ARMYs. The septet is assumed to get back to work by end of January 2022. This is the first time that they're spending time with families in holiday season.

Who will ever forget the time when Jin shocked ARMYs by dropping a shirtless picture to flaunt his tattoo? Also, Jin working out in the jin created a huge stir","ARMYs go gaga all the time Last but not least, we have the Golden Maknae Jungkook on the list.  Also, on stage personality of J-Hope is super hot! Jimin's visuals are very different from his personality when with the group.  And honestly, he often seems unreal.  And these days, especially after BTS made their debut on Instagram, they have been sharing posts unfiltered.  And today, we will have a look at some of the thirst traps that the Bangtan Boys have set First up, we have BTS leader Kim Namjoon aka RM.  Be it his bare body selfies/videos or his photoshoots, Taehyung has often left ARMY gasping for breath.  But everyone knows he's not a baby.  But there's no dearth of BTS content.  Especially ever since he has started keeping long hair.  Fans are going to miss this mischievous golden maknae when he enlists in the military.  Gone are the days when we would get updates only from Weverse or Twitter.  He is a fantastic dancer and it's impossible to take one's eyes off him when he is on stage.  He is often teased about his height and comes across as a shy and kind-hearted one.  He just sets a thirst trap with selfies and close-up shots.  Here are some of the close-up shots of Yoongi that left ARMYs gasping for breath.  His crooked smirk is also quite famous Earlier, there was a time when just a forehead being exposed was considered a huge thing in the kpop world.  Hobi has been dropping a lot of bare body selfies leaving ARMYs in a tizzy.  However, Jimin can flirt with ARMYs just with his gestures and expressions.  It won't be wrong to say that they have been setting thirst traps for ARMYs.  Jungkook also loves to flaunt his abs.  Jungkook has a different aura on stage and he always sets the stage on fire.  Jungkook is usually considered a baby.  Jungkook loves working out and ARMY loves his boxing videos a lot.  Kim Seokjin is soon going to enlist in the military.  Of course, on stage Suga is quite HOT.  Sadly, he deleted them all.  Sometimes, Taehyung steals everything just with his expressions.  The exposed forehead to his photoshoot in a vest, Jin often makes ARMY go gaga Nobody can do it like Yoongi.  The latter seems dormant to another level.  While the ARMYs are proud, they are going to miss WWH Jin. BTS ARMY, the Bangtan Boys have been surprising us all ever since they all debuted on Instagram",5.481160855419282,2022-10-31T07:00:00Z,1,1

Here&rsquo;s more on what we know about his health and the tour

As soon as he confirms his return, the agency promises to inform his followers of the same  They also genuinely regret any inconvenience caused to the fans and beg for their understanding that this choice was necessary for Haechan&#39;s well-being  The agency pledges to do whatever is necessary, to work hard and to help Haechan so that he may meet the fans with a healthier image 

What are the dates of the tour?

The band NCT kickstarted their world tour back in October 2022, after the release of their fourth studio album, 2 Baddies  NCT 127 has performed in many places like LA, Jakarta, Bangkok, Korea, etc  Following this enthusiasm, NCT 127 decided to excite its fans in the United States once again  NCT 127 revealed nine additional dates for their forthcoming Neo City: The Link globe tour on December 8, 2022  Seven more locations, including Chicago and Houston in the United States, S&atilde;o Paulo, and Santiago in Latin America, will host performances by the K-pop boy band  The K-pop superstar will perform during the revised dates, which are January 9&ndash;January 28 of 2023 

What are the exact city lineups?

According to the poster, three further gigs are scheduled for Chicago on January 9, Houston on January 11, and Atlanta on January 13  NCT 127 will next go to Latin America where they will perform six performances in four different locations  They will begin by performing in Sao Paulo, Brazil from January 18 to 20, then move on to Santiago, Chile on January 22, Bogota, Colombia on January 25, and Mexico on January 28  With such lineups, we can only conclude that this is NCT&#39;s largest tour in America, and the band&#39;s followers are eagerly anticipating an amazing live performance 

Haechan will miss NCT 127&#39;s Tours in Latin America and the US

Haechan was notified that he would not take the stage on the next NCT 127 US and Latin American tour dates for obvious health issues  Having a member absent from the schedule because of illness is not the first time the NCT has encountered such a situation  Jaehyun had the same issue before, and Mark Lee had also spoken about his exhaustion during the group&rsquo;s comeback 

Who will attend?

Haechan&#39;s absence owing to his sickness means that NCT 127 will now play on this tour with fewer members  The other 8 members&mdash;Yuta Nakamoto, Jaeyun, Taeyong, Jungwoo, Mark Lee, WINWIN, Doyoung, Johnny, and Taeil&mdash;will take part in the USA/Latin America performances as planned  This is one of the most loved sub-units of the SM Entertainment group NCT, and their tickets usually get quickly sold out  Hopefully, the fans will finally get to see at least 8 members at the end of the month, minus Haechan  We are certain that the concert will still be wonderful even without Haechan because the other members will all be present 

NCT 127&rsquo;s much-needed comeback

We can only be more thrilled for the band NCT 127 to make their comeback now that the tour has begun and their repackaged album Ay-Yo will be released later this month 

Having said that, Haechan is presently taking care of himself and hoping that he will soon feel well  We can only hope that he meets all of his fans and gets back with his band soon  We wish him a quick recovery

"BTS aka RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook, that is, the Bangtan Boys' Memories of 2021 has been released in a DVD format. ARMYs have been sharing clips of the same online and have been going gaga over how close the BTS members really are. The Bangtan Boys' goofiest and adorable sides along with the hottest personalities are seen in Memories of 2021. Talking about the goofiness of the Bangtan Boys, we came across a clip from Memories of 2021 which features RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook shooting together. The Tannies reject one of Jungkook's ideas during a photoshoot. And it's relatable and hilarious at the same time It so happened that the BTS members were shooting the concept photos for Festa 2021. And for the same, the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and JK – were seen in colourful outfits that made them look like cotton candies of different colours. They were all copying poses suggested by each of the BTS members. RM suggested a Michael Jackson posture, Hobi suggested a crab posture, and Suga had a cute posture, too. BTS V aka Kim Taehyung had the easiest one out of all. He suggested striking his signature V pose for the pictures Out of them all Jimin, Jungkook and Jin had difficult postures. Jimin's posture was that of sitting on a chair in the air. Jin's was a hard side-way lean which almost tripped Taehyung. But the most difficult of it all was Jungkook's posture. It was a Yoga posture wherein one balances his/her body on his hand. And right away, the idea was rejected by the members. It's funny and relatable at the same time. Jungkook is fond of exercising and working out. So are others but sometimes, the things that Jungkook does easily are difficult for the rest of the Bangtan Boys Meanwhile, during Festa Dinner this year, the BTS members announced that they will be taking a break from the hectic work schedule as the boyband. They are now 'focussing' on their individual artistry. And it just means more content of BTS members for the ARMY","And for the same, the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and JK – were seen in colourful outfits that made them look like cotton candies of different colours.

"While the whole world is fanboying over him and his fellow bandmates, BTS member Jin has never shied away from showing one celebrity he truly loves and is a massive fan of  The singer&#39;s love for Brad Pitt has also become &#39;worldwide famous&#39; just like his worldwide handsome title  Brad Pitt may have many fans but we bet there&#39;s no one as dedicated as Kim Seok-jin &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s &#39;Hollywood crush&#39;&nbsp;

It all started back in 2017 when Jin first namedropped Pitt and left everyone surprised  The Astronaut singer also received a rather funny reaction from his bandmates after he answered a question for an Access Hollywood interview  Jin created an iconic moment when he named Brad Pitt as his &quot;Hollywood crush&quot; and chose to name the actor as his favourite instead of any actress &nbsp;

Jin&#39;s dream collaboration&nbsp;

On another occasion, the singer once again proved his love for Brad Pitt and it was when the members were being interviewed on iHeartRadio Live in 2020 where they discussed their MAP OF THE SOUL: 7 album, their 2020 world tour, their new collaboration with Lauv, and more  It was during this interaction that the members were asked about future collaborations and whom they would like to work with next  The answers from the members turned out to be interesting as V name Ariana Grande, Suga picked Post Malone  Although when it came to Jin, the singer once again left everyone stumped with his answer when he said, Brad Pitt &nbsp;

Instead of picking another musical artist, Jin picked Pitt above everyone and that shows what a true fanboy he is of the Bullet Train star  His answer also provoked a response from RM who joked, &quot;He&rsquo;s gonna shoot a movie &quot; Although the thought of Jin and Brad Pitt acting together certainly left ARMYs screaming with joy given how they have been waiting to watch Jin explore his actor side as well &nbsp;

"We are looking back at December 2021, when BTS alum and leader RM spoke to Vogue Korea about some of the biggest concerns in his life! Reflecting on how his life has changed since debuting with the Bangtan Boys in 2013, RM looked back at their initial music and compared to their newer ones, he said: “[This music] was heartfelt at the time, but trends change quickly, and I realized that my own ear [for music] has changed quite a bit  Will ‘Butter‘ and ‘Permission to Dance‘ also sound outdated once time has passed? Because we live within trends, I’ve gotten used to [going along with what’s fashionable at the time], but I don’t think I should live like that  I’m not sure what to do, but I want to produce something ‘long-lasting’ and ‘timeless ’ Now that it’s been been nearly nine years since I debuted as BTS, I’ve started thinking about that a lot ”RM also shared: “In the past, I used to have a lot of rules in my head, like ‘You need to do this or that,’ and I was caught up in the idea of wanting to show off something amazing, such as an impressive technique  These days, I focus on trying to create a certain texture that I want to convey in an abstract way  I’ve developed the ability to think in multisensory dimensions, such as vision or touch  When you create music, there are different elements like lyrics, melody, beat, and voice, and my approach is to look at the sum of all these things together to see if they express what I originally wanted to convey ”Considering BTS’ popularity and representing South Korea in front of a global audience, the idol was asked if the responsibility is ever limits the band artistically or while making music  RM responded: “At times, representing the nation feels great, and at other times, it can be a lot of pressure  What’s certain is that this role isn’t something we achieved because we sought it out, and it’s not something that goes away just because you want it to  I think it’s my fate to accept it as my calling and do a good job at what I can  If I had to put it into words, I’d say that I’d like to live my life while thinking, ‘This kind of life is fun too '”ALSO READ: Will you debut as the eighth member of BTS?","We are looking back at December 2021, when BTS alum and leader RM spoke to Vogue Korea about some of the biggest concerns in his life!

"Is BTS really on a hiatus? Well, hiatus or not, there's no dearth of content featuring the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. We would be getting some amazing solo content from BTS members soon RM aka Kim Namjoon is the leader of BTS, Bangtan Sonyeodan. He has been in charge of keeping together the other six members and maintaining harmony and leading the pack. And while doing so, Joonie aka RM turned from Rap Moster to RM (Real Me), father-figure types. From Namjoon comforting a crying Taehyung to being concerned about Jungkook and Jimin sleeping on the floor. From giving piggyback rides to J-Hope to helping the eldest child - Jin - whenever he is stuck. From collecting the members for a hug to cheering on the members being cute and adorable. And also being strict with the boys when they get out of hand, especially the maknae line - Park Jimin aka Jimin, Kim Taehyung aka V and Jeon Jungkook aka Jungkook. Despite RM not being the eldest member, he has turned into someone the Bangtan Boys rely on and look up to on various things. RM lets the boys be themselves and accepts all their shenanigans like a resigned father. Well, it is very funny and goofy. Who knew RM's dream of being a dad would come true in this way? Teehee, just kidding Meanwhile, RM is not new to solo projects. He has dropped two mixtapes of his own RM (2015) and Mono (2018) which were widely acclaimed. Mono had peaked at 26 on Billboard 200 which was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in chart history. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few. He has a KOMCA credit score of 199. He is gearing up for his solo album next and hopes that he is the one to release his solo project after J-Hope","BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few.

"BTS' J-Hope aka Jung Hoseok's Jack In The Box is releasing today and Hobi has been busy partying since the last night. The BTS rapper is dropping his solo album today and he held a listening party of the same last night. It was a starry affair at the HYBE building where other BTS members RM, Taehyung, Jin, Jungkook and Jimin had dropped by to support him. Whether or not Suga attended is not known but some of the ARMYs seem to have spotted him, though there are no pictures confirming the same BTS member J-Hope's listening party for Jack in the Box was held on HYBE's last floor. The videos and pictures from the same are going viral on social media. Apart from BTS members - RM, Jin, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook, J-Hope's listening party was attended by various kpop artists such as BIGBANG's Taehyung, Uhm Jung Hwa,  Korean hip-hop legendsTiger JK, Yoon Mirae and many more. Seeing Hobi's popularity and the kind of response to his listening party, ARMY is brimming with pride Jungkoook and J-Hope danced to Butter's remix ft. Megan Thee Stallion at J-Hope's listening party. At first, Hobi was dancing on it solo and seeing his hyung, Jungkook joined him, still recalling the 2J's choreo they set on the remix version of Butter. We wish Jimin had joined them too. Elsewhere, Taehyung, Hobi and RM's video of dancing together also went viral.

"BTS and military enlistment has been a burning topic. The boys announced that they are on a group hiatus and would continue with solo activities for a while. Many felt this was because of the impending military enlistment. Now, South Korea's defence minister Lee Jong-sup has dropped a statement, which is quite interesting. He has said that the boys can perform at global concerts in their enlistment period. The minister made this comment on Monday in the middle of a debate on whether military service for K-Pop stars should be shortened to three weeks. As of now, the period is close to two years. In South Korea, every able-bodied male in the age group of 18-28 must join the South Korean army In December, Kim Seokjin aka Jin who is the eldest of the BTS boys will turn 30. He has to enlist in the military by January 2023. Before that, the boys will perform at the global concert in Busan which is a promotional bid for the World Expo in 2030. Since 2019, there is a revision due to which popstars can defer military service till the age of 30. As we know, military service is a must as the country has threat from North Korea, which is one of the top five nuclear powers in the world. Only few people have got exemptions or the chance to do a shorter service. They include Olympics and Asian Games medal winners and some classical musicians-dancer who win at prestigious international competitions like Chopin Piano Competition The Parliament is debating if a bill can be passed to shorten military service of K-Pop stars. The music industry rakes in billions for the economy in a year, and BTS is the biggest income generator. The pool of personnel resources in South Korea is decreasing due to low birth rates. This is due to a number of reasons ranging from cost of living to unwillingness of citizens to have babies Now, Big Hit Music has not commented on this statement made by the Minister. He was quoted as saying in the Korean media, ""Even if they join the military, there would be a way to give them a chance to practise and perform together if there are scheduled concerts abroad. As many people highly value (artists serving) in the military, that may help boost their popularity even more."" In April 2021, an official said that this uncertainly over military enlistment had caused mental stress to the Bangtan Boys. They are now doing solo work. We saw J-Hope's solo album and his performance at Lollapalooza in Chicago, which was a huge success This news item has left BTS ARMY with mixed reactions. One of them commented on Twitter, ""Like ""you got to do your military service and also work at the same time, because we want you to serve the military but don't want to lose the money that you bring to our country's economy. We don't care if you die of exhaustion as long as you bring us money and done your srvice"", while someone else wrote, ""Wowww. This is this INSANELY SELFISH.

BM of the mixed group KARD released the solo digital single &#39;Strangers&rsquo; recently, according to the agency DSP Media  &lsquo;Strangers&rsquo; is a song that depicts the two-sided emotion of instinctive attraction towards the other person and fear that comes from ignorance With this song, BM made her solo comeback about 7 months after the song &#39;LOST IN EUPHORIA&#39; in January 2022  In addition to the title song, this digital single also includes &#39;Bad Intentions&#39;, which has the theme of ambivalence 

&#39;Strangers&#39;, which contains the tension of being attracted to a stranger, contains the instinctive attraction towards the other person, the fear that comes from ignorance, and the feelings of the boundary  With its heavy tone and deep grooves, BM transforms strange tension with strangers into a thrill, causing a transfer of emotions to listeners  The accompanying song &#39;Bad Intentions&#39; is a song about contradictory emotions  Through this song, BM wanted to say that someone&#39;s actions may differ from their intentions based on various contradictory human emotions rather than judging someone with a clear dichotomy 

BM described &#39;Strangers&#39; as a very exciting and sexy song  It&#39;s a song that makes one feel both thrilled and anxious at the same time, thrilling and a little dangerous at first sight  BM has firmly established his own music world not only as a group, but also as a solo artist  While repeating free musical attempts with sensuous beats and heavy bass, he also participates in visual work, demonstrating his stylish artistic capabilities in various fields 

BM as a KARD member and a solo artist:

Regarding his identity as a KARD member and a solo artist, he has always said that after all, while working as a group, he found a color that suits the team, gathered the worries and opinions of many people, and moved toward the best  On the other hand, as a solo artist, he knew that he could also show ideas or images that he could not show in the group activities  Both KARD activities and individual activities are always colorful, and he wants to show a limitless image as an artist 

Now, as an artist, there are so many things he could do and wants to do  He said that he wants to prove that he can do various things as an artist  As he is constantly working on individual songs, he wants his fans to look forward to his work in the future  Being a person with a different personality, he will always try new things to keep his fans entertained &nbsp;

KARD&#39;s last comeback:

KARD&rsquo;s last comeback was Ring the Alarm from their 5th mini album Re: which is a song in the Moombahton genre of the &#39;Summer Invincible&#39; card  The mood of &#39;Let&#39;s have fun in this new time&#39; was portrayed with rhythmical bass sounds and synthesizer and guitar sounds that feel the summer atmosphere  BM, who participated in writing the lyrics along with member J Seph, added weight to KARD&rsquo;s music and gave it an addictive feel with heavy rapping in a low-mid tone 

Here are some K-Pop lingo to know :-&nbsp;

Nugu- the romanization of the Korean word &lsquo;누구&rsquo; which means who and in this context nugu is for small, unknown groups of the K-Pop industry  These groups are not popular but some fans bring them forward on Twitter and Instagram to boost their popularity &nbsp;

Locals- people are not interested in K-Pop but spend time talking about how bad the industry, music, groups and other things are  They see certain incidents from the outside and give their opinion on it without understanding how the industry/culture works &nbsp;

Touching grass- it&#39;s a phenomenon where fans return to the real world/reality after being sucked into the world of K-Pop MVs, variety shows, comeback performances etc  They realize that it is time to get in touch with reality &nbsp;

Moot- Mutual follower on Twitter&nbsp;

OOMF- one of my followers&nbsp;

Soft Stan- a fan who loves the innocent and soft part of their bias or group  They prefer aegyo and babying their idols&nbsp;

Hard Stan- a fan who loves their K-Pop idols wild side and prefers when their bias displays their sex appeal during performances &nbsp;

Delulu- a delusional person

SUNGHOONED-&nbsp;like the eternal internet prank, being &lsquo;Rick-Rolled&rsquo;, SUNGHOONED is the K-Pop version where a normal video will be shown which has some suspense to it and in the end, ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Sunghoon will be shown dancing &nbsp;

Eating CDs- this means that the artist sings just as amazingly in a live performance  The slang means The artist sounds as good as they do in the recorder version &nbsp;

ult- the ultimate bias/ ultimate favourite person in the group  It also applies to a group  This slang means that the person/group comes above everybody else &nbsp;

As he is constantly working on individual songs, he wants his fans to look forward to his work in the future.  BM has firmly established his own music world not only as a group, but also as a solo artist.  Being a person with a different personality, he will always try new things to keep his fans entertained.  Both KARD activities and individual activities are always colorful, and he wants to show a limitless image as an artist 

Now, as an artist, there are so many things he could do and wants to do.  He said that he wants to prove that he can do various things as an artist.  In addition to the title song, this digital single also includes &#39;Bad Intentions&#39;, which has the theme of ambivalence 

&#39;Strangers&#39;, which contains the tension of being attracted to a stranger, contains the instinctive attraction towards the other person, the fear that comes from ignorance, and the feelings of the boundary.  It also applies to a group.  It&#39;s a song that makes one feel both thrilled and anxious at the same time, thrilling and a little dangerous at first sight.  On the other hand, as a solo artist, he knew that he could also show ideas or images that he could not show in the group activities.  The accompanying song &#39;Bad Intentions&#39; is a song about contradictory emotions.  The mood of &#39;Let&#39;s have fun in this new time&#39; was portrayed with rhythmical bass sounds and synthesizer and guitar sounds that feel the summer atmosphere.  The slang means The artist sounds as good as they do in the recorder version.  These groups are not popular but some fans bring them forward on Twitter and Instagram to boost their popularity.  They prefer aegyo and babying their idols 

Hard Stan- a fan who loves their K-Pop idols wild side and prefers when their bias displays their sex appeal during performances.  They realize that it is time to get in touch with reality.  They see certain incidents from the outside and give their opinion on it without understanding how the industry/culture works.  This slang means that the person/group comes above everybody else.  Through this song, BM wanted to say that someone&#39;s actions may differ from their intentions based on various contradictory human emotions rather than judging someone with a clear dichotomy 

BM described &#39;Strangers&#39; as a very exciting and sexy song.  With its heavy tone and deep grooves, BM transforms strange tension with strangers into a thrill, causing a transfer of emotions to listeners",7.018036766013934,2023-01-09T08:12:02Z,3,9

"K-pop idol Cha Eun Woo has put everything and more into his role for the fantasy action K-drama &#39;Island&#39; which began airing a couple of weeks ago  His acting which has been under review, all because of the typically stoic boy portrayals he received previously, gives way for people to notice just how much he has grown since the college ridden love stories where he was penned as just the handsome one or the lonely Prince on the lookout for his rightful place  In all those roles it seemed as if he was always finding ways to fit in, never fully accepting his surroundings and seeking familiarity 

In &#39;Island&#39;, Cha Eun Woo, snatches the plot right from the start to make it his own  He injects himself into the story as if embracing it with his whole might, and though the 25 year old plays five years younger, he makes it believable thanks to the mischief in his eyes and the sheer gut to challenge what could possibly kill him, all at the drop of a hat  Speaking in Italian, fans would make note of his increased hotness quotient while we can notice the efforts from the actor who seems to have gone all in 

What is the story of Island?

&#39;Island&#39; is a webtoon inspired K-drama brought to life thanks to a statement making ensemble, fairly impressive VFX and an immersive storyline  Here, the chaebol daughter of the famed Daeho group, Won Mi Ho, is sent off to Jeju Island for repenting for her actions  She encounters bloodthirsty demons on her way who she is unable to fight  A man intervenes with his dagger, hawk-like eyes, unbelievable speed and the urge to kill  Found to be Van, the suited man is tight-lipped and only appears when Won Mi Ho is in need of his help  As the old prophecy awakens and lust demons threaten to kill the unaware woman, a Priest named Yohan becomes curious about the happenings in South Korea and decides to return 

Introduction to Cha Eun Woo in Island as Priest Yohan

As he is initially introduced, Giovanni is a young boy named Kang Chan Hyeok who moved to Italy in his earlier days and returned at the age of 20 after being called upon by the pull of a prophecy  Here, he makes himself known as Priest Yohan, a popular Priest who has moved around saving humans from the wrath of spirits  His methods are none the ordinary as he channels his love for Hallyu aka the Korean wave while dealing with evil  While it may sound funny, it adds the necessary edge to Cha Eun Woo&#39;s character &nbsp;
With a pair of headphones around his ears, RnB music blasting through it, he uses ignorance to fend off the evil  Ruthless, he charges ahead while chanting and using a crucifix to burn through the negative energies  With sneakers on his feet and a spring in his step, he manages to surprise you with each action &nbsp;

The latest episode of &#39;Island&#39; saw Yohan bring out a pointed sword-like object and use it against Van, the character played by Kim Nam Gil, who is a half-human and half-demonic presence among them, managing to hide from everyone but the Priest who is out for his blood  The chemistry between Cha Eun Woo and Kim Nam Gil as they bicker, waiting to break out into a fight any moment, is better than we expected &nbsp;

Cha Eun Woo preparing for the role of Yohan

In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, the ASTRO member digs deep into his preparation for the character of Priest Yohan  He mentions going to cathedrals and meeting up with real-life Priests to learn the know-how of his role  On being asked what training he received, Cha Eun Woo opened up saying, &ldquo;While playing the role of a priest named Yohan, I had to take Italian or Greek and Latin lessons since I had such scenes  I went to a cathedral to see a priest and learned about the basics of Catholicism  Whenever I speak, I wanted it to be more Yohan-like, I worked on it so it could be more fitting to the role &ldquo;

Introduction to Cha Eun Woo in Island as Priest Yohan

As he is initially introduced, Giovanni is a young boy named Kang Chan Hyeok who moved to Italy in his earlier days and returned at the age of 20 after being called upon by the pull of a prophecy.  I have some wounds and those bits were difficult but, I feel proud and it was fun portraying the character &rdquo;

What is the story of Island?

&#39;Island&#39; is a webtoon inspired K-drama brought to life thanks to a statement making ensemble, fairly impressive VFX and an immersive storyline","Cha Eun Woo preparing for the role of Yohan

In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, the ASTRO member digs deep into his preparation for the character of Priest Yohan.  

The latest episode of &#39;Island&#39; saw Yohan bring out a pointed sword-like object and use it against Van, the character played by Kim Nam Gil, who is a half-human and half-demonic presence among them, managing to hide from everyone but the Priest who is out for his blood.  
With a pair of headphones around his ears, RnB music blasting through it, he uses ignorance to fend off the evil.  A man intervenes with his dagger, hawk-like eyes, unbelievable speed and the urge to kill.  Found to be Van, the suited man is tight-lipped and only appears when Won Mi Ho is in need of his help.  He injects himself into the story as if embracing it with his whole might, and though the 25 year old plays five years younger, he makes it believable thanks to the mischief in his eyes and the sheer gut to challenge what could possibly kill him, all at the drop of a hat.  He mentions going to cathedrals and meeting up with real-life Priests to learn the know-how of his role.  He spoke about the difficulties of working on the sets, &ldquo;I used my body a lot.  Here, he makes himself known as Priest Yohan, a popular Priest who has moved around saving humans from the wrath of spirits.  Here, the chaebol daughter of the famed Daeho group, Won Mi Ho, is sent off to Jeju Island for repenting for her actions.  His acting which has been under review, all because of the typically stoic boy portrayals he received previously, gives way for people to notice just how much he has grown since the college ridden love stories where he was penned as just the handsome one or the lonely Prince on the lookout for his rightful place.  His methods are none the ordinary as he channels his love for Hallyu aka the Korean wave while dealing with evil.  I went to a cathedral to see a priest and learned about the basics of Catholicism.  In all those roles it seemed as if he was always finding ways to fit in, never fully accepting his surroundings and seeking familiarity 

In &#39;Island&#39;, Cha Eun Woo, snatches the plot right from the start to make it his own.  On being asked what training he received, Cha Eun Woo opened up saying, &ldquo;While playing the role of a priest named Yohan, I had to take Italian or Greek and Latin lessons since I had such scenes.  Ruthless, he charges ahead while chanting and using a crucifix to burn through the negative energies.  She encounters bloodthirsty demons on her way who she is unable to fight.  The chemistry between Cha Eun Woo and Kim Nam Gil as they bicker, waiting to break out into a fight any moment, is better than we expected.  When I was rolling over a mountain or something like that, I got some small scars and it hurt a little.  Whenever I speak, I wanted it to be more Yohan-like, I worked on it so it could be more fitting to the role &ldquo;

On the other hand, since he is known for performing exorcisms, Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s character takes on action scenes frequently and the actor worked on them with just as much enthusiasm, getting bruised while pulling them off with all his might.  While it may sound funny, it adds the necessary edge to Cha Eun Woo&#39;s character.  With sneakers on his feet and a spring in his step, he manages to surprise you with each action. K-pop idol Cha Eun Woo has put everything and more into his role for the fantasy action K-drama &#39;Island&#39; which began airing a couple of weeks ago",7.43333040893709,2023-01-09T10:50:47Z,3,9
"TOMORROW X TOGETHER has established itself as one of the frontrunners of this generation&rsquo;s K-pop music thanks to their genre-hopping music and a total takeover of today&rsquo;s style  Their songs have always impressed the audiences, having become longtime favourites of the MOAs who always chip in, in large numbers, expressing their surprise and admiration at every chance that they get at the sincere and fabulous music 

Now, returning with their fifth Korean EP, TOMORROW X TOGETHER is coming back to the music scene after a world tour and performances at music festivals, New Year&rsquo;s special stages, and more  After teasing their fans about the album for months now, the group finally announced their next EP after 8 months, following the release of their fourth mini-album &lsquo;Minisode 2: Thursday&#39;s Child&rsquo; in May 2022, on December 15 at midnight KST  It was revealed that their next series will begin with &lsquo;The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION&rsquo;  It continues from the conclusion of their earlier two series, namely, &lsquo;The Dream Chapter&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Chaos Chapter&rsquo; 

The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION

To be made available in total three versions, Daydream, Nightmare and Farewell, the upcoming schedule ahead of the album drop was teased  Starting from January 9 to the day after the release on January 28, the plan was revealed to the fans, with a &lsquo;Lullaby&rsquo; concept photo version set to be unveiled on January 15 at midnight KST  The promotion scheduler introduced the mysterious concept for this album which was followed by a concept teaser which said, &ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s voice that I encountered by the window of midnight was sweet &rdquo; It was accompanied by an eerie video of a silhouette and a butterfly, giving hints about the comeback &nbsp;

The mood teaser that followed was a peek into the wild ride that awaits at the end of the pre-release promotions 
https://twitter com/BIGHIT_MUSIC/status/1612011232898486272TXT&rsquo;s first concept photos

The first set of concept photos for the quintet&rsquo;s upcoming mini album &lsquo;The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION&rsquo;, was released on January 9  Titled &lsquo;Daydream&rsquo;, they stayed true to the concept as the fans collectively let out a shriek of surprise looking at the dream-like photos  Playing right into the theme of &lsquo;temptation&rsquo; the younger twenty year olds, seemed to be ready to show more skin this time around  With loose-fitting unbuttoned jackets, barely covering their torsos, these concept photos were nothing like what the fans have seen before  Barefooted and with light makeup, they seemed to be becoming one with nature  Fans appreciated the sculpted bodies of the five boys and trended hashtags like &lsquo;CALM DOWN&rsquo; on social media, expressing their astonishment 
https://twitter com/BIGHIT_MUSIC/status/1612101833115467776Looking at the introduction to the upcoming album, here&rsquo;s what we can expect from it 

TXT&rsquo;s bare bodies

We&rsquo;re sure the fans are not complaining but it seems that there will be a lot of shirtless or barely-there outfits in this comeback  The first set of concept photos is enough to hint  The adolescent boys who were once in colourful outfits singing about their crowns have grown and matured enough to scream about their lost love and now turn to something completely different  Maybe they&rsquo;ll be calmer this time around? More reserved? We can only wait to find out 

Unbelievable visuals

Not that we had any doubt before this, but the few photos we have seen so far of the five members of the group have once again instilled our belief about their flawless visuals  With light makeup or rock looks, their fit and tall frames in the latest, trendy and expensive wear or even in the most simple outfits, TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s members can pull it off and look top-notch at the same time 

Exceptional choreography

This one&rsquo;s a no-brainer  Essentially creating a world full of some of the most followed and loved dance sequences over and over again, the synchronised and visually pleasing moves of Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun and Huening Kai make it all the more exciting to wait for their releases  Fierce moves, stunts and dance breaks make for the group&rsquo;s viral sets with each song  Every time, they add fun elements to their choreographies to make it unique and we hope this time&rsquo;s no different 

Live vocals

Over time, TOMORROW X TOGETHER has made one thing very clear- they can sing, and that too very beautifully  Remember Yeonjun&rsquo;s Lonely Boy live rap? A moment that will forever be etched into the memory of not just fans but any viewers of the clip, the boy group always returns with tracks that heavily rely on their singing abilities 

A superhit album

When there are so many success-prone elements going into the making of these well-tailored music releases, the K-pop all-rounders may as well be ready for another hit album to add to their satchel  The first look has already raked in thousands of pre-orders across the world and it is only bound to grow in huge numbers henceforth 

We&rsquo;re looking forward to the release of TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION&rsquo; on January 27 at 2 pm KST

"BTS' fame is such that there is no doubt that the K-Pop band is by far not only one of the most popular music groups in today's time, but also among the most iconic of all time, with Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, Jungkook, V, Suga and RM (those are the BTS members for the uninitiated) enjoying fame, fans and impact that cuts across every ethnic, cultural and geographical demographic known to us.

Of course, ARMY was driven mad wondering what could it be about and was waiting with bated breath for an answer or even half a clue. Alas, that half a clue has been provided via Hollywood news reports The cat is finally out of the bag at least somewhat, as BTS' official Instagram handle has unveiled a teaser related to the aforementioned pic, showcasing a special 8-photo folio that captures an even more dreamy and mysterious side of Jungkook. The teaser video is titled “Mood 'Inner Self'”, and if the pic has send the internet into meltdown, this video has the potential to set fire to every nook and cranny of the web.

"BTS and ARMY share a loving bond. On the occasion of Valentine’s Day, ARMYs go into the imagination mood. Well, many of them are in that frame of mind 365 days a year but V-Day further amplifies the feelings. BTS members RM, SUGA, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope or V rarely discuss their private lives or what they feel about love or romance. However, BTS ARMY can imagine what kind of boyfriends they did be or perhaps what would turn them in partners. In fact, some members like SUGA, Jin and Jungkook have said some truly romantic things in front of BTS ARMY that made hearts mushy. BTS leader RM can tease fans, that too in the most sophisticated of manner. And what would we say about Jimin and V. Many fans feel that Kim Taehyung is the God Of Romance and Seduction in BTS while Jimin is the lover who has a heart full of warmth. Just ahead of Valentine’s Day 2022, let us see the romantic quotient of the Bangtan Boys… BTS maknae Jeon Jungkook is quite a romantic. He once said he did do anything for the girl he loves. Jungkook also made fans feel mushy when he said he did like to recreate the epic kissing scene from the movie Love 911. This proves that he is quite a romantic at heart BTS member J-Hope has a passion for dance and keeping others happy. Jung Hoseok or Hobi is perceptive, hard-working and caring. ARMYs felt very sad when he revealed that he was dumped by his girlfriend in school. J-Hope loves romantic shows as they inspire his lyric-writing. He said he dreams of finding true love like the one seen on Crash Landing On You. Isn’t that too romantic? ARMYs can dream of that one epic love story knowing this fact about Hobi In an old video, BTS Jin has spoken about how he dreams of cooking food with his partner when he has one. In fact, he said that his food got burnt at times as he was too deep in the thought. If food is your language of love, then Kim Seokjin is your perfect Valentine’s Day date. He can make you a great meal, tell you dad jokes and go the extra mile to have you roll on the floor with laughter. BTS Jin is quite traditional in his ideals of love BTS rapper, music producer and songwriter SUGA is on a high. Old BTS ARMYs know that Min Yoongi has a way with words. He told fans to keep their fourth finger empty (for the marriage ring), and coolly asked for the documents when someone proposed to him. SUGA is always flooded with marriage proposals and why not. Min Yoongi can sing, play instruments, write you a song, prepare a nice meal and even take you for a long drive (he has a grade one driving license). SUGA has written some of the most romantic notes for fans some of which are part of old BTS archives. The letter written for his former girlfriend is a reflection of how he feels about relationships and love BTS front-man RM is admired by millions. A skilled rapper, composer, music producer and songwriter RM is the complete package. He can also be a tease if he wants to. Remember what he said to husbands of ARMYs on the Zoom pyjama party. Fans dream that a date with RM would mean a walk through a museum enjoying art or soaking in the sights of nature. He is a man who loves all the finer things of life. Though he has not spoken about his romantic side, ARMYs only imagine how life would be with a man as hot and intelligent as Kim Namjoon. He is the perfect Valentine’s Day date for all sapiosexuals BTS member V is known for his good looks, charisma and deep baritone. Whether it is Sweet Night from Itaewon Class or Christmas Tree from Our Beloved Summer, he is someone who has given some truly romantic OSTs. In fact, his video from Hawaii where he was singing Travel With Me while driving a Mustang conjured up images in the minds of ARMY on how romantic Kim Taehyung could be as a partner. From sharing pics of starlit skies to setting up thirst traps at 3 am posing shirtless, BTS V is known as the God of Seduction BTS Jimin is full of love, warmth and compassion. Jimin once said he wanted to meet the parents of ARMYs for giving birth to such loving fans. He is also someone to reach out with empathy and kindness. His recent note for a fan is proof. If you love kindness is a man, he is your perfect guy","From sharing pics of starlit skies to setting up thirst traps at 3 am posing shirtless, BTS V is known as the God of Seduction BTS Jimin is full of love, warmth and compassion.

Isn’t that too romantic? ARMYs can dream of that one epic love story knowing this fact about Hobi In an old video, BTS Jin has spoken about how he dreams of cooking food with his partner when he has one.

BTS Jin is quite traditional in his ideals of love BTS rapper, music producer and songwriter SUGA is on a high.  BTS leader RM can tease fans, that too in the most sophisticated of manner.  BTS members RM, SUGA, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope or V rarely discuss their private lives or what they feel about love or romance.  Fans dream that a date with RM would mean a walk through a museum enjoying art or soaking in the sights of nature.  He can also be a tease if he wants to.

He told fans to keep their fourth finger empty (for the marriage ring), and coolly asked for the documents when someone proposed to him.  His recent note for a fan is proof.  However, BTS ARMY can imagine what kind of boyfriends they did be or perhaps what would turn them in partners.  If food is your language of love, then Kim Seokjin is your perfect Valentine’s Day date.  If you love kindness is a man, he is your perfect guy.  In fact, he said that his food got burnt at times as he was too deep in the thought.  In fact, some members like SUGA, Jin and Jungkook have said some truly romantic things in front of BTS ARMY that made hearts mushy.  J-Hope loves romantic shows as they inspire his lyric-writing.  Jimin once said he wanted to meet the parents of ARMYs for giving birth to such loving fans.  Jung Hoseok or Hobi is perceptive, hard-working and caring.  Jungkook also made fans feel mushy when he said he did like to recreate the epic kissing scene from the movie Love 911.  Just ahead of Valentine’s Day 2022, let us see the romantic quotient of the Bangtan Boys… BTS maknae Jeon Jungkook is quite a romantic.  Many fans feel that Kim Taehyung is the God Of Romance and Seduction in BTS while Jimin is the lover who has a heart full of warmth.  Old BTS ARMYs know that Min Yoongi has a way with words.  On the occasion of Valentine’s Day, ARMYs go into the imagination mood.  Remember what he said to husbands of ARMYs on the Zoom pyjama party.

The letter written for his former girlfriend is a reflection of how he feels about relationships and love BTS front-man RM is admired by millions.  This proves that he is quite a romantic at heart BTS member J-Hope has a passion for dance and keeping others happy.  Well, many of them are in that frame of mind 365 days a year but V-Day further amplifies the feelings.  Whether it is Sweet Night from Itaewon Class or Christmas Tree from Our Beloved Summer, he is someone who has given some truly romantic OSTs.

"BTS' fame is such that there is no doubt that the K-Pop band is by far not only one of the most popular music groups in today's time, but also among the most iconic of all time, with Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, Jungkook, V, Suga and RM (those are the BTS members for the uninitiated) enjoying fame, fans and impact that cuts across every ethnic, cultural and geographical demographic known to us. So, it comes as no surprise that ARMY (that's what BTS fans the world over refer to themselves as) can't get enough of BTS and make it a point to keep up to date with every little development about the group So, if you consider yourself one amongst ARMY, then this latest BTS news should be right up your alley. For those of you who were quite worried about BTS’ oldest member Kim Seokjin aka Jin after he performed both at the Grammys and the group's Las Vegas tour, here's some good news. Jin seems to have completely recovered from his injury, with his cast also having come off as evidence in a bunch of pics the singer-songwriter recently posted on his official Instagram account.' While the first post has Jin posing with his arms outstretched surrounding by some buildings, it's his second IG post that has grabbed everyone's attention as he's spotted sitting between two large Pikachu (from the Pokemon series, for the uninitiated) soft toys and medium-sized Pokeball soft toy on his lap. However J-Hope's commenting, “You’re going around alone and doing cute stuff by yourself,” accompanied by a fire emoji is what's putting the icing on top of Jin's post J-Hope's comment is particularly amusing because Jin had earlier revealed he would keep asking him out for drinks while his bandmate seemed busy with other stuff, so this time, J-Hope's comment almost makes it seem like he was ready to go out for drinks, but Jin decided to enjoy himself solo – all in good jest though","However J-Hope's commenting, “You’re going around alone and doing cute stuff by yourself,” accompanied by a fire emoji is what's putting the icing on top of Jin's post J-Hope's comment is particularly amusing because Jin had earlier revealed he would keep asking him out for drinks while his bandmate seemed busy with other stuff, so this time, J-Hope's comment almost makes it seem like he was ready to go out for drinks, but Jin decided to enjoy himself solo – all in good jest though","For those of you who were quite worried about BTS’ oldest member Kim Seokjin aka Jin after he performed both at the Grammys and the group's Las Vegas tour, here's some good news.

49AfuuRbgGoDo you remember the OG K-pop stars 2NE1? If you do not, you are probably not the die-hard K-pop fan that you pretend to be because they were FIRE, literally FIRE, when it came to their songs and performances  And this soundtrack is an example of one of their many masterpieces  Undoubtedly, one of the most fiesty all-girls K-pop bands 2NE1&#39;s sole purpose in curating the song, FIRE, was to turn the heat up and set the roofs ablaze  From its addictive chants to its siren-like vocals - this infectious dance track is simply irresistible  So, come on, don&#39;t fight the urge; it is time to rockaby baby, rockaby!

&nbsp;

2  Arson by J-Hope (BTS)
QmpTkkaKYSUArson is a solo track by the BTS member J-Hope  The usually bright J-Hope showcases a more sinister and dark side of himself in this unnervingly minimal instrumental song  He continues to rap in a rumbling and menacing tone, gradually changing into a more urgent and unstoppable rage with a sense of blazing silence as he is being consumed by angst  On days you, too, feel being consumed by flaming angst, put on your headphones and listen to this song, and it will dump your angst in a burning pit!

&nbsp;

3  PLAYING WITH FIRE by BLACKPINK
9pdj4iJD08sRemember how your eyes lit up when you see someone that you love? Yes, the same happens with and in this music video by BLACKPINK

Do you feel the raging fire inside you?

&nbsp;

4  HOT by SEVENTEEN
gRnuFC4UalwThe song HOT is from the album Face The Sun, both of which bring in the heat  From incandescent fireworks (dayum) in their fiesty music video and its relentless siren-like electronic chirps to the scorching sun in the desert area - the K-pop band, SEVENTEEN was very sure when they named the song HOT  So, people time to turn on your air conditioners because it&#39;s HOT-HOT-HOT!

&nbsp;

5  Blue Flame by ASTRO
wS7anrSXKrYGenerally, bluer fame is thought of as cool, calm, and collected against the fiery red hot flame  However, K-pop band ASTRO&#39;s Blue Flame will take you on a passionate and dark journey with fierce Latin pop in its verses  This soundtrack is more of a slow burn that has the depth to light up even the darkest of nights with (both) the impressive lyrics and the band&#39;s sensual singing capabilities equally!

&nbsp;

6  FIRE by BTS
4ujQOR2DMFMIf the members of this K-pop band were not fire enough in themselves, they, sure as hell, were in this music video  FIRE by BTS is that one song that rages inside every loyal fan of the BTS Army  The uproar of the word fire throughout the music video metaphorically represents how the BTS sets the stage alight with their iconic dance choreography, engulfing the world in flames  Try stopping yourself once your soul is set ablaze with this song!

49AfuuRbgGoDo you remember the OG K-pop stars 2NE1? If you do not, you are probably not the die-hard K-pop fan that you pretend to be because they were FIRE, literally FIRE, when it came to their songs and performances.  FIRE by BTS
4ujQOR2DMFMIf the members of this K-pop band were not fire enough in themselves, they, sure as hell, were in this music video.  FIRE by BTS is that one song that rages inside every loyal fan of the BTS Army.  From incandescent fireworks (dayum) in their fiesty music video and its relentless siren-like electronic chirps to the scorching sun in the desert area - the K-pop band, SEVENTEEN was very sure when they named the song HOT.  From its addictive chants to its siren-like vocals - this infectious dance track is simply irresistible.  HOT by SEVENTEEN
gRnuFC4UalwThe song HOT is from the album Face The Sun, both of which bring in the heat.  He continues to rap in a rumbling and menacing tone, gradually changing into a more urgent and unstoppable rage with a sense of blazing silence as he is being consumed by angst.  However, K-pop band ASTRO&#39;s Blue Flame will take you on a passionate and dark journey with fierce Latin pop in its verses.  It is all about the fya folks; check it out!

 

6 Intense K-pop songs that will surely turn up the heat

 

1.  It is as if the K-pop singers absolutely love the fire metaphorically.  On days you, too, feel being consumed by flaming angst, put on your headphones and listen to this song, and it will dump your angst in a burning pit!

 

3.  So, come on, don&#39;t fight the urge; it is time to rockaby baby, rockaby!

 

2.  So, people time to turn on your air conditioners because it&#39;s HOT-HOT-HOT!

 

5.  The music video portrays a risky love that you can not take your eyes off and keep ignoring all the red flags, and ultimately your world ends up bursting into flames! Do you feel the raging fire inside you?

 

4.  The uproar of the word fire throughout the music video metaphorically represents how the BTS sets the stage alight with their iconic dance choreography, engulfing the world in flames.  The usually bright J-Hope showcases a more sinister and dark side of himself in this unnervingly minimal instrumental song.  These brilliant compositions infectiously burst to life, making K-pop fans lose themselves in their music 

 

This article will talk about 6 of such brilliant songs where you will literally feel their blazing passion as you groove along with them.  This soundtrack is more of a slow burn that has the depth to light up even the darkest of nights with (both) the impressive lyrics and the band&#39;s sensual singing capabilities equally!

 

6.  Undoubtedly, one of the most fiesty all-girls K-pop bands 2NE1&#39;s sole purpose in curating the song, FIRE, was to turn the heat up and set the roofs ablaze.  Whether their songs mention burning up the stage with raging passion or scorching the past with smoldering tracks - K-pop superstars have never shied away from producing dope and zealous song tracks. From BLACKPINK&#39;s Fire to (G)I-DLE HWAA - K-pop artists truly have curated some lit songs",6.464287079358213,2022-11-17T08:00:00Z,3,9

There is a concerted effort on part of Durga Puja pandals across the country to make kids aware of the heritage, culture and tradition behind the festival. This is a way to attract the youth. Moreover, maximum K-Pop fans in India come from the eastern part of the country. Take a look at the video The above video was played on the occasion of Mahasaptami which is devoted to the worship of Goddess Kalratri. She is one of the most fierce forms of the Goddess.

"The latest episode of BTS&rsquo; fun program was called &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius&rsquo; and the second part of this edition had the fans of the group rolling on the floor with laughter and shedding tears at the same time  Here are the highlights from the episode as well as why the BTS ARMY may need tissues soon 

About Run BTS

South Korean boy group BTS began a show called &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; on the heels of their then-just-released track &lsquo;Run&rsquo; which started off into a basic introduction and has blossomed to become a high fan favourite weekly catch-up turned occasional show  From 2015 to taking a break in late 2021 and resuming with special episodes in 2022, the show has indeed come a long way  However, it may soon have to put brakes on the run 

Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 1 Recap

The first part of show&#39;s latest editionshow introduced the fans to tiny games involving the BTS members who played card games and were subjected to lie detection under the scrutiny of each other&rsquo;s eyes as some fun &lsquo;cat ears&rsquo; (electroencephalograph ones)  Even with not a lot at play, the BTS members ensured their hilarity was at its peak best and spread joy with their content  &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 2&rsquo; was teased with more screaming, laughter and games at the expense of the seven members 

The dice-y game

With a lot of points at stake, the BTS members played a long winding game of dice which required them to throw it and declare a digit making others guess if they were saying the truth  If they&rsquo;re caught, they move backwards, successful and they march right ahead  With Jungkook playing a dangerous game right from the start, the BTS members had the most fun teasing him about it as he kept going back to the start point  An honest player right from the get-go, SUGA was the first to pass through and made it past the end line in a swoop  The game turned calculative and funny at a point as some of the members including RM and Jimin kept going back and forth by continuously objecting to other people&rsquo;s declarations and poking fun at each other 

The Yes or No betrayal

Rock, Paper and Scissors

The final game to decide the winner was laid out as the infamous &lsquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rsquo; which has become known for ensuring big battles in the world of K-pop  Also frequently used to decide on the most basic things, the game was played through cards and divided the team of BTS into two, with half on the side of V and the other half on Jimin&rsquo;s side  They each had three rounds to decide their 5 cards with rock, paper or scissors on them with advice from the other members  However, only the members themselves knew their original sides ensuing a lot of suspicion and chaos  While Jimin doubted those giving him suggestions, V dedicatedly followed all that was told to him  A last spurt of 10 seconds had them change up everything adding more havoc to the already crazy game  Finally, when the other members&rsquo; loyalties were revealed, SUGA managed to fool everyone by being at Jimin&rsquo;s side all the time and in fact belonging to V&rsquo;s team, meanwhile, J-Hope&rsquo;s changing alliances finally found a home with the other 1995 star &nbsp;

Is Run BTS ending?

Jungkook made a fleeting comment towards the end of the episode as he said, &ldquo;Yes, like this  As of today, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s ending &rdquo; making the rest of the six laugh in shock as they stopped him  They confirmed that one more episode was left to shoot  The captions confirmed that another filming schedule for &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; before Jin&rsquo;s enlistment, the last one for a while, has indeed been planned &nbsp;

While it may not mean that the show is coming to an end, it is indeed true that Jin may not be a part of the other upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes if the group decides to continue shooting after his enlistment which took place on December 13, though highly unlikely  This means that after another edition, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; may end up taking another break (if they&rsquo;ve not shot for more than one episode after this) until the military services of all other members are also complete and they reconvene sometime in 2025 as previously revealed

About Run BTS

South Korean boy group BTS began a show called &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; on the heels of their then-just-released track &lsquo;Run&rsquo; which started off into a basic introduction and has blossomed to become a high fan favourite weekly catch-up turned occasional show.  However, it may soon have to put brakes on the run 

Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 1 Recap

The first part of show&#39;s latest editionshow introduced the fans to tiny games involving the BTS members who played card games and were subjected to lie detection under the scrutiny of each other&rsquo;s eyes as some fun &lsquo;cat ears&rsquo; (electroencephalograph ones).  This means that after another edition, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; may end up taking another break (if they&rsquo;ve not shot for more than one episode after this) until the military services of all other members are also complete and they reconvene sometime in 2025 as previously revealed

While it may not mean that the show is coming to an end, it is indeed true that Jin may not be a part of the other upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes if the group decides to continue shooting after his enlistment which took place on December 13, though highly unlikely.  &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 2&rsquo; was teased with more screaming, laughter and games at the expense of the seven members 

The dice-y game

With a lot of points at stake, the BTS members played a long winding game of dice which required them to throw it and declare a digit making others guess if they were saying the truth.  A last spurt of 10 seconds had them change up everything adding more havoc to the already crazy game.  Also frequently used to decide on the most basic things, the game was played through cards and divided the team of BTS into two, with half on the side of V and the other half on Jimin&rsquo;s side.  An honest player right from the get-go, SUGA was the first to pass through and made it past the end line in a swoop.  As of today, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;.  Even with not a lot at play, the BTS members ensured their hilarity was at its peak best and spread joy with their content.  Finally, when the other members&rsquo; loyalties were revealed, SUGA managed to fool everyone by being at Jimin&rsquo;s side all the time and in fact belonging to V&rsquo;s team, meanwhile, J-Hope&rsquo;s changing alliances finally found a home with the other 1995 star.  From 2015 to taking a break in late 2021 and resuming with special episodes in 2022, the show has indeed come a long way.  However, only the members themselves knew their original sides ensuing a lot of suspicion and chaos.  If they&rsquo;re caught, they move backwards, successful and they march right ahead.  In tthe &lsquo;95 liners, members V and Jimin, camewho came out on top as they each picked &lsquo;No&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s ending &rdquo; making the rest of the six laugh in shock as they stopped him.  Soon after, all seven of them secretly revealed their answers and the minority would determine the winners.  The captions confirmed that another filming schedule for &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; before Jin&rsquo;s enlistment, the last one for a while, has indeed been planned.  The game turned calculative and funny at a point as some of the members including RM and Jimin kept going back and forth by continuously objecting to other people&rsquo;s declarations and poking fun at each other 

The Yes or No betrayal

The fourth game was one testing the loyalties of the BTS members as they all sent out signals to each other hoping for cooperation.  The two were the top two contenders for the finals, competing in an upcoming fierce match 

Rock, Paper and Scissors

The final game to decide the winner was laid out as the infamous &lsquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rsquo; which has become known for ensuring big battles in the world of K-pop.  They confirmed that one more episode was left to shoot.  They each had three rounds to decide their 5 cards with rock, paper or scissors on them with advice from the other members.  They were all sent to a room to ask if they&rsquo;d like to split the points with all members and had to choose yes or no.  While Jimin doubted those giving him suggestions, V dedicatedly followed all that was told to him.  With Jungkook playing a dangerous game right from the start, the BTS members had the most fun teasing him about it as he kept going back to the start point. The latest episode of BTS&rsquo; fun program was called &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius&rsquo; and the second part of this edition had the fans of the group rolling on the floor with laughter and shedding tears at the same time",8.129666111253375,2023-01-11T14:03:28Z,3,1

"BTS member Jungkook celebrated his 25th birthday yesterday. And the young handsome man conducted a live session with the BTS ARMY and had a fun Karaoke/ acapella concert session online. Jungkook sang songs as he always does and answered a few questions, honoured ARMY's song request. He was drinking as well, it seems. And it's really unlikely and rare when BTS members don't make an appearance in other BTS members' live. And that's what happened last night. BTS' eldest member, Kim Seokjin aka Jin, made an appearance. Jin was a little drunk. Jin and Jungkook's interaction during the VLive won a lot of hearts Jin made a surprise appearance at Jungkook's birthday party. He popped up from behind the kitchen counter where he had been hidden until Jungkook started his LIVE. Jin gifted grapes to Jungkook and added that he is not promoting the grapes from his uncle's farm and was just passing by to give them all to the members. Jin then proclaimed that he has changed his mind since it was late. He shared that Jungkook was the second member he visited. BTS' eldest member Kim Seokjin was very talkative as usual. But this time, he was also a little drunk When Jin shared that he has had one glass of drink, Jungkook exposed him that he has had two glasses. Later, Jin made Jungkook pretend that he brought the cake. Jin had intended to bring the cake but since it was too late night in night and all the cake shops were closed for the day. A little tipsy Jin wholeheartedly sang the birthday song for Jungkook who also pretended to be very much surprised Jungkook's birthday VLive is one of the biggest trends in Hollywood News. ARMY thought that Jungkook would come online the night before and begin his birthday with them. But there was no update on it. But Jungkook conducted the live late in the night right before his birthday ended. Jin's short but a surprise visit was quite goofy and adorable and it won a lot of hearts. Jin thought that he'd be the only member who would come and greet Junkook on his birthday but he was stumped twice when Jungkook revealed that Jimin had dropped by. Jin started taking the names of every BTS member and missed out on J-Hope's name and took Jungkook's name instead. It was one adorable moment of Jin from the live.

Rumors of RM and Jungkook attending 2023 Grammys&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, there have been rumors that BTS leader RM aka Namjoon and Jungkook will be soon travelling together to attend the 2023 Grammys  RM is expected to be representing BTS at this year&#39;s awards ceremony while Jungkook&rsquo;s attendance is under question  BTS has created history by being nominated for three categories for the 2023 Grammy Awards  These include Best Music Video for &lsquo;Yet To Come&rsquo;, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the collaboration track &lsquo;My Universe&rsquo; along with Coldplay, and Album of the Year for Coldplay&rsquo;s &lsquo;Music of the Spheres&rsquo;  This is the third consecutive year in which BTS has been nominated for the Grammy Awards

BTS members have yet to react to nominations or rumors of RM and Jungkook travelling to the U S A  for the award ceremony  However, RM did share an Instagram story over the announcement video along with tagging Coldplay in November 2022 following the revelation of the nominations 

Did the Grammys purposefully snub BTS last year?

When BTS released their first ever English title track &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo; in 2020, it broke several long-standing records on multiple platforms including breaking the record of most views on YouTube within 24 hours, ranking in the Billboard Hot 100 Chart for consecutive thirty-two weeks, reaching 100 iTunes No 1s in just eight hours, ranking first on Global Top 50 chart on Spotify&rsquo;s daily, along with breaking two Guinness World Records  The release of &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo; further earned BTS their first Grammy nomination in 2021  With these incredible achievements of BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;, it was consistently questioned why this K-pop group ended up being mere nominees and not the winner of the award 

This was also repeated last year when BTS was nominated for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for &lsquo;Butter&rsquo;  They lost this award to Doja Cat and SZA&#39;s song &lsquo;Kiss Me More&rsquo;  The seven members of BTS not only made a distinctive entrance to the awards ceremony, but they also completely wowed the audience with their smashing performance while even bringing in Olivia Rodrigo for a cameo

One user tweeted that even though they are happy for Doja Cat to win the award, the decision is extremely unfair as the Grammys have snubbed the biggest pop songs for two consecutive years  While other fans simply tweeted that even though BTS has not won a Grammy, they are still the real winners  ARMY even started questioning the credibility of the show 

This controversy further fueled several allegations of xenophobia and racism considering the previous track record of the Grammys  Users noted that throughout the years there has been a lack of diversity and differential treatment of artists of colour  BTS fans were quick to talk on their socials accounts that not winning Grammys does not make one of the best K-pop groups any less valuable 

BTS has certainly made a huge impact on the music industry  There is not only the K-pop group&#39;s best commercial success, but they have also garnered a fan following of millions of people around the world  It is even interesting to note that from this Korean boy group, only RM is fluent in English and yet they have resonated with people around the globe, breaking any language barriers

"Last week, two Pakistani teenage girls were reported missing from their home in Korangi, Karachi city  Police discovered that these teenage girls were not kidnapped but rather ran away to meet their favourite K-pop musical sensation BTS  They had made plans to travel to South Korea and with an extensive search, police later found them in Lahore this week 

Here are more details about how these teenage girls ran away from their homes and how police found them 

Two teenage girls reported missing

As per the police report, two girls, aged 13 and 14, went missing from their home in Karachi on January 2, 2023  The older girl went to her younger friend&rsquo;s home and they both went outside for some time  However, they were nowhere to be found when their fathers went searching for the girls  The father assumed that the girls might have been kidnapped or gotten involved in a foul situation by unknown assailants  This is why the father reported a missing complaint for the thirteen year old daughter 

How did the police find the girls?

When police became involved, they started with a thorough search of the 13 year old girl and then they understood the teenage girls&#39; intention to flee to South Korea and meet their favourite K-pop group BTS  During this extensive police search, a diary was found of the 13 year old girl which revealed their plans 

Police stated to CNN in an interview that the diary included details such as train timetables and details of another friend of theirs who was also planning to run away with the two teenage girls  In this handwritten diary, they also prepared a plan to reach Islamabad by train  The police interviewed this other friend  They also claimed that the duo even wanted to take their relative Naufil with them but Naufil refused to take this plan 

A forensic examination was also conducted by the police for their deleted browsing data and WhatsApp chats, which further confirmed that they left their homes to go to South Korea and join the K-pop sensation BTS  The girls carried out thorough online research on South Korea, including things to do, types of clothes to wear, things to avoid, and so on  The duo Googled these things and made their plans accordingly 

After finding this information, the police aggressively started searching for the duo, whose location was traced to Lahore, which is 1200 kilometres from their home  The girls travelled to Lahore by train  The police in charge of the investigation later found that the two teenage girls were in police custody in Lahore 

The duo were found by a patrolling constable at a railway station  They seemed in miserable condition and were trying to disguise themselves as boys so they got overlooked  When the duo were initially probed, they complained about the indifferent attitude of their parents and wanted to live life on their own terms  The girls are in safe and sound condition as of now 

A cultural journalist who spoke to CNN about this case mentioned that the decisions and risks taken by girls were not so surprising since &lsquo;stans&rsquo; are known to do anything for their idols  This is why it is important to create a safe and organized space for fan girls so that they can freely engage with each other and talk about their favourite idols rather than taking the risk of fleeing from home 

The senior superintendent of Karachi said that they had made arrangements with the Lahore police to coordinate bringing these teenage girls back home  He further urged parents to monitor the online activities of their children in a video statement

"On January 13  BIGBANG member Taeyang released his long-awaited comeback with a single named &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; and the other thing making the music world go gaga over this release was the featuring artists  Taeyang had brought in BTS member Jimin to collaborate on this song and it soon took over the K-pop world in a frenzy  This amalgamation of Taeyang&rsquo;s long-adored vocals returning after 6 years and Jimin&rsquo;s charismatic presence venturing into his solo world, was one nobody expected but everyone celebrated soon after its announcement 

The question, however, remained: where did the thought of &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; first begin? Who first approached whom and if any difficulties stood between them while working on the song  Taeyang held a countdown live broadcast an hour before dropping the song on THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s YouTube channel and delved into the details of this collaboration 

Taeyang spills about collaboration with Jimin

On being asked where did the idea of working with Jimin first stem from, the BIGBANG member recalled an incident on a casual night in THEBLACKLABEL studio after dinner, he was conversing with producer Teddy Park who is known for being the man behind a lot of BLACKPINK&rsquo;s superhit tracks like &lsquo;AS IF IT&#39;S YOUR LAST&rsquo;, &lsquo;DDU-DU DDU-DU&rsquo; and the girls solo tracks, and is also the co-founder of THEBLACKLABEL, which is Taeyang&rsquo;s new agency  While thinking about his upcoming projects including a solo album, the popular producer mentioned how fun it would be to have Taeyang and Jimin on one song  He added that if the two worked together, people would love it  This was also when BTS primarily did group activities and the members were not as active as solo artists &nbsp;

Teddy Park&rsquo;s words in passing were taken seriously by the 34 year-old as the thought stuck in his mind  While he had never pondered over the possibility before, the simple mention made him think of a great collaboration that would come to fruition a couple of years later 

How did Taeyang and Jimin meet?

BIGBANG and BTS are two supergroups that have made themselves known globally  The members each have a massive fan following  But unfortunately they&rsquo;ve never been spotted together previously, up until 2022 when they began attending similar events and going to the same parties  Taeyang seemed to be aware of this gap in their matching schedules as he mentioned how their promotional activities had never overlapped before  Moreover, the singer had also never asked anyone to collaborate with him before this and found it difficult to come across someone he&rsquo;d like to work with 

To his rescue, last year there were a few dinners that the BIGBANG member got invited to where he had an opportunity to meet BTS  Taeyang spoke about coming across the group&rsquo;s members one by one and eventually becoming acquainted with Jimin  Simple chats later, they ended up talking about working together some day and Taeyang asked Jimin if he&rsquo;d like for them to make music together which finally resulted in going to the studio and working on the track that is now called &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo; 

Taeyang and Jimin shooting for VIBE

The singer also spoke about working for other promotional bits like teaser photos at the music video filming site  He added that they tried to add an older feel to the song, making them feel like a hip hop duo 

Manoeuvring their different labels

Taeyang belonged to YG Entertainment when the creation of this song first began and has since moved to its subsidiary THEBLACKLABEL following the expiration of his exclusive contract in December 2022  On the other hand, BTS member Jimin is an artist with BIGHIT MUSIC, and overall to HYBE  Moreover, it is rare for the BIGBANG members to collaborate with someone, more so outside of their own agency  So, Taeyang spoke about having to work out that bit for the song and how he as well as Jimin wished to make a great song as well as the music video for &lsquo;VIBE&rsquo;  During a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the singer talked of the BTS member taking a lot of effort for this song, which he had come to appreciate greatly

ARMY is shocked beyond words after looking at JK in that avatar Talking about Jungkook's picture that HYBE dropped on Twitter, JK has long hair, red eyes, and reddish lips. He has a ruffled collar shirt as well. The eyebrow piercing is also being noticed by the ARMY. All in all, Jungkook is giving out the vibes of some novella.

"BTS member V, who is also known by his real name Kim Taehyung, has been a globally loved superstar  Being one of the BTS members has obviously earned him the due fame that he has worked hard for ever since his debut in 2013, however, his &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; self and unbounded charisma has let him explore different opportunities  One of these was his K-drama acting debut with &lsquo;Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth&rsquo;  Since then, V has not taken up any acting projects and has continued to promote with BTS as it grew humongous on a global scale and dipped into little solo work, including the creation of his solo album which is expected to be released sometime soon  However, the demand for his return continues, maybe growing bigger with time as fans root for more &lsquo;actor V&rsquo; 

BTS&rsquo; V in Hwarang

V was the first from BTS to delve into K-drama acting after his debut and did so with KBS2&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth&rsquo;  Alongside the leads of Park Seo Joon, Park Hyung Sik, Go Ara and a cast full of popular actors like Choi Min Ho, Seo Yea Ji, V became the maknae everyone adored  In the character of Seok Han Sung, he was the youngest as also in real life, adding to the fun 

While the show ended with V&rsquo;s character (SPOILER ALERT) Han Sung&rsquo;s dramatic death, it was a scene that will be remembered in the BTS fandom for a long time  A lot of praise went to the K-pop star as it was his first attempt at acting in a K-drama, seemingly seeing a lot of effort and emotion in action  As one of the Hwarang men, he trained endlessly and carried a jolly attitude becoming a favourite of everyone  Everyone talked about his relationship with Park Seo Joon&rsquo;s character&nbsp;as they expressed camaraderie beyond on-screen presence  V became best friends with actors Park Seo Joon and Park Hyung Sik after the filming was done and they came together with actor Choi Woo Shik and musician Peakboy to form the Wooga Squad  On the other hand, his on-screen friendship Go Ara&rsquo;s character was also a fan favourite 

Most popular Korean celebrities on IMDb

While the list was recently made public, what caught the netizens&rsquo; attention was spotting BTS&rsquo; V on it at a very high position  Essentially, a ranking of sorts gauging people&rsquo;s interest in Korean celebrities related to films, it was unexpected to spot the name of Kim Taehyung in it as he has never previously acted in a movie  While BTS themselves have released various cinematic collections of their concerts and their journey in the music world, none were ones that had them showcase their acting to the audience &nbsp;

First on the list is Park Chan Wook, the director behind mindblowing creations like &lsquo;The Handmaiden&rsquo;, &lsquo;Oldboy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thirst&rsquo; and more recently, &lsquo;Decision to Leave&rsquo;  One of the most prominent personalities in the world of Korean film, he has upheld his name for quite a long time now  His depth in terms of understanding various dark stories and bringing them to life has been appreciated by critics globally  Leading the list is a very obvious pick for the 59 year old whose work people always look forward to 

Following closely behind is director Bong Joon Ho who has become a pioneer in the movie industry thanks to his contribution to internationally acclaimed projects like &lsquo;Memories of Murder&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Host&rsquo;, &lsquo;Snowpiercer&rsquo;, &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo;  The last one earned a Palme d&#39;Or and 3 Academy Awards making quite the roar across the film fraternity  Known for his black humour and socially unique topics, he occupies the rightful second place on the list 

Steven Yeun grabs the third position owing to his notable roles in films like &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burning&rsquo; as well as the TV show, &lsquo;The Walking Dead&rsquo;  He established himself with varied roles that allowed him to be considered for unique characters  His nomination as the first Asian-American actor at the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role has been immensely written about 

V takes fourth place on the popularity list thanks to his acting in &lsquo;Hwarang&rsquo; as well as the online presence he has built so far with his elegant, relatable and all-giving nature  Multiple international directions have previously expressed their interest to cast him  While he is yet to sign any films, fans are definitely looking forward to actor Kim Taehyung making a return to their screens sooner rather than later

In South Korea, ""SOLO"" debuted at the top of the Gaon Digital Chart, and it also topped the Billboard World Digital Song Sales Chart.  In addition to the other songs they had previously released in Japanese, they also included new Japanese translations of ""As If It's Your Last"" and ""Whistle ""6.  It was the group's second song to surpass 2,500,000 certified downloads in South Korea, joining their first two songs.  It's just a song that emphasizes that everything we need is already within us.  Japanese translations of BLACKPINK's most well-known songs from their debut were included on the CD.  Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, founded Blackpink in 2021 to promote K-pop around the world and recognize them as a global K-pop phenomenon.  Not a modest accomplishment for a band making their debut 2.  On July 14, ""Forever Young"" was released as the second single, closely after it 7.  She provided information about the song, including the lyrics' meaning.  Sometimes when you're constantly on the go, you kind of forget to take care of what is important to you.  The album became the first by a Korean girl group to achieve 500 million Spotify streams, proving that their efforts were fruitful.  The album's October release date was postponed from its initial September 2019 release date 12.  The first was called ""Playing with Fire ""4.  The other two Korean musicians to reach number one were PSY and Big Bang In August 2016, ""Whistle"" also topped the Gaon Chart's digital, download, streaming, and mobile charts.  The song was written by Selena Gomez and included largely English lyrics for a catchy summertime tune 15.  The songs ""Kill This Love,"" ""Don't Know What To Do,"" ""Kick It,"" ""Hope Not,"" and ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du (Remix)"" are all available in Japanese.  There's no need to search for it outside Square One, the first single album by Blackpink, included the songs Whistle and Boombayah.  This Japanese album did not contain any Korean versions of their songs, unlike their earlier Japanese albums 10.  This includes the lead track, ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du,"" which is currently wildly successful.  This was the group's second appearance on an album for a different artist.  With an opening position of number 55, ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" is also the highest-charting Hot 100 single ever for an all-female K-pop ensemble.  With more than 60 million subscribers, the girl group Blackpink earned their sixth Guinness World Record in 2021 for having the highest YouTube subscribers.

NewJeans also joins BIGBANG and 2NE1 as the third idol group and sixth artist in Melon history to simultaneously occupy all three top spots of Melon&rsquo;s Weekly Charts after Ditto, OMG and Hype Boy took up the top spots  It also makes the first group to achieve this feat in 8 years! Previously, only BIGBANG and 2NE1 were able to do so, once again showing NewJeans&rsquo; popularity &nbsp;

Based on the Melon TOP100 chart on January 17th, NewJeans&#39; &#39;Ditto&#39; is number one  After its release on December 19 last year, it drew attention as it maintains the top spot in competition with the songs of prominent artists  It is also noteworthy that the unchanging top charts, including &#39;Ditto&#39;  Younha&#39;s &#39;Event Horizon&#39; and BIGBANG&#39;s&nbsp;Taeyang&#39;s &#39;VIBE&#39; (Feat  BTS&#39; Jimin) were ranked 4th and 5th, respectively

Lee Hwa Jeong, a researcher at NH Investment &amp; Securities, said that NewJeans is expected to enter the Billboard main single chart Hot 100 with the new song &#39;Ditto&#39; and It is a achievement after half a year of debut, and it is not a sparkling effect right after the album release  It deserves special attention  Unlike the album chart (Billboard 200), where K-pop artists frequently appear, in the case of the single chart (Hot 100), publicity indicators such as streaming, sales, and radio airplay for each song must be supported to enter  It is relatively difficult, he emphasized  For reference, considering that the starting point for BLACKPINK&rsquo;s public awareness in the US was when &#39;DDU-DU DDU-DU&#39; entered the Hot 100 in 2018, it is particularly worth paying attention to &nbsp;

NewJeans&rsquo; Ditto:&nbsp;

The &#39;monster rookie&#39; NewJeans, who entered their 5th month of debut, are doing an overwhelming job  In addition to the long-term box office success of their debut songs, they are building new records by succeeding in consecutive box office hits with two of their recently released singles  NewJeans released their first single album &#39;OMG&#39; on the 2nd  This album, which contains the title song &#39;OMG&#39; and &#39;Ditto&#39;, which was released in advance last month, talks about a relationship once again in a slightly strange distance and a little unfamiliar background, showing New Jeans&#39; unique winter sensibility

In particular, according to the US Billboard, NewJeans&#39; &#39;Ditto&#39; ranked 4th on the Billboard &#39;Global (excluding the US)&#39; and 8th on the &#39;Global 200&#39; on the chart dated the 14th  This is NewJeans&#39; own highest ranking record, and New Jeans became an artist who entered the top 10 of the &#39;Global 200&#39; and the top 5 of the &#39;Global (excluding the US)&#39; in the shortest period as a K-pop group &nbsp;

OMG:&nbsp;

&#39;OMG&#39;, which was released following &#39;Ditto&#39;, which reached No  1, also quickly swept the top of the charts and succeeded as a box office success  It ranked first on the real-time music charts in Korea, and ranked second on the daily chart after &#39;Dito&#39;  It continued to receive enthusiastic responses abroad  It settled at 25th place on the Spotify &#39;Daily Top Song Global&#39; chart (as of the 6th) and 95th place on the &#39;Weekly Top Song Global&#39; chart (first week of January)

BTS&rsquo; journey with Louis Vuitton

In 2019, the South Korean group first worked with the fashion house for their outfits while doing album promotions  However, 2021 marked the group&rsquo;s official start with the label as they were roped as in the global brand ambassadors  The septet also rocked then-Artistic Director Virgil Abloh&rsquo;s Men&#39;s Fall-Winter 2021 collection  It is being said that the contract between the fashion house and the group is now up after 2 years of successful collaborations 

Jimin with Dior

On January 16, BTS member Jimin was announced as the official global brand ambassador for the French luxury fashion house  Reports point out that he is officially the 18th current ambassador for the brand and the 1st Asian male celeb to be named so  This deal follows the group&rsquo;s long-running history with the brand as Dior had designed the members&rsquo; stage outfits for their &lsquo;Love Youself: Speak Yourself&rsquo; world tour back in 2019  Jimin&rsquo;s oomph in carrying his outfits makes him a perfect fit for the brand 

SUGA with Valentino

Known as the rapper of the group, member SUGA of BTS is so much more  From providing his meaningful insights to his chart-topping productions, he has been leading the group&rsquo;s success in multiple ways alongside the other six  Following his recent visit to Los Angeles where a special collaboration between him and the Italian luxury fashion house was announced, on January 17 he was officially declared as the brand&rsquo;s newest brand ambassador  He will join the group of people known as Di Vas, an acronym for Different Values that they hope to endorse with their products  The BTS member will be helming the Maison Valentino Essentials campaign with which he aims to propagate his shared values of diversity alongside the brand 

Will J-Hope continue with Louis Vuitton?

On the same day, Louis Vuitton announced that J-Hope will be heading to the 2023 Paris Fashion Week to attend the brand&rsquo;s Men&#39;s Fall-Winter 2023 Fashion Show on January 19  The BTS member has previously teased his possible partnership with the brand through Instagram stories shared on his account in the past week  It also seems that a new solo fashion project with the &lsquo;Jack In The Box&rsquo; singer is in the work and will likely take his own famed style quotient into consideration 

Member Jimin is also expected to join J-Hope on his visit to the Paris Fashion Week for his own promotions ahead of the former&rsquo;s upcoming solo debut  Apart from these, there have been no confirmed signed deals with any brands for the rest of the members  Here&rsquo;s what we can expect in the coming days 

RM for Bottega Veneta

A probable plan for signing the BTS leader could be in the works for the Italian brand which was seen throughout RM&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; promotions  While it is possible that Kim Namjoon chose his outfits based on his own preferences rather than a fashion deal, fans are hoping that the smart styling becomes the right fit for him  To add to their beliefs they&rsquo;ve found out that Matthieu Blazy, the creative director, and Dario Gargiulo, the chief marketing and digital business officer of Bottega Veneta started following the BTS member recently 

V for Celine

It is more likely than not that the BTS member signs with the French luxury brand following his solo gig alongside BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa and Park Bo Gum last year which went viral for all the right reasons  V is known to harbour a special liking for the brand and can easily carry their confident fits with flair  Fans are also hoping that he signs with Gucci which has a more fancy style, going perfectly well with the K-pop star 

Jungkook for Versace

The youngest from the group was spotted in a fabulous fit from the brand for his performance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony  It went well with the expensive but pleasing look that the BTS member is known to admire  They also have edgier options for when Jungkook wishes to do different and following the group&rsquo;s meeting with Donatella Versace at the 64th GRAMMY Awards, it seems more than likely 

Jin for Cartier

While the oldest member is currently serving in the military and will not sign anything until he&rsquo;s back, fans are rooting for Jin&nbsp;to land a deal with Cartier with whom they think he would be the best fit &nbsp;
