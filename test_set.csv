"Sharing the new picture, the company clarified that they didn’t intend to disrespect Jungkook. “Hello everyone, here's the revised version of the previous photo. There was a mistake while editing the skin tone and there was no intention to disrespect the artist. As we promised, this kind of mistake won't take place again. We always respect our brand ambassador,” tweeted the brand and tagged the official Twitter account of BTS. Reacting to the apology tweet, a fan commented, “Why would you even edit that?” “When will it be fine to accept natural skin tones in photos?” questioned another one. “I didn’t even noticed the mistake,” added someone else. The previous advertisement showed the letter ‘J’ erased from Jungkook’s tattoo on his ring finger. The brand had previously tweeted, “Hello, everyone. We sincerely apologise that we've missed the precious ‘J’ letter on JK's hand. We'll soon replace it with the revised version, and make sure it won't happen again. Again, we are really sorry.” Apart from this, the ad campaign had also grabbed ARMY’s attention as Jungkook debuted with his most unusual hairstyle—a mullet. While some fans praised the hairstyle, others quickly pointed out that it was not real hair, but extensions. BTS is currently waiting for the release of their upcoming anthology album Proof. The album will be a combination of members' old songs and new tracks, such as Yet To Come, Run BTS, Born Singer, Boy in Luv, Danger, IDOL, Dynamite, On, Butter and Life Goes On, among others.

"A total of three images have been released on Instagram. In one of them, V, popularly known as Kim Taehyung, is seen softly gazing towards the camera in an all-white look at an outdoor setting, in another he is seen patiently waiting outside a bedroom while the last one is a close-up shot of him making eye contact. All of these as a part of a surprise second set of pictures from his first solo photoshoot for the magazine as the members are focusing on solo careers. Reacting to the sweet surprise, BTS ARMY took to Twitter and started trending V with hashtags like #TAEHYUNGxVOGUE. One fan wrote, “the SerVe absolutely stunning and gorgeous as always! V ICON OF AN ERA V FOR VOGUE KOREA.” “Belongs in a museum!!” commented another fan. Someone else added jokingly, “This is illegal to be this fine.” Earlier on August 27, fans started speculating about the photo shoot after the magazine’s fashion director posted an update on Instagram Stories hinting about a photoshoot likely with a BTS member. She shared a sneak peek of the styling reference and later deleted it, which raise further speculations. Later on September 4, the same magazine's editor-in-chief and other associates confirmed the rumours with a glimpse of V’s upcoming photoshoot. A few days later, the first preview of V’s pictorial was released and confirmed the schedule for the cover, which people ‘will remember for ages.’ This was also followed by a throwback interview with V.

As per a statement by Hybe, Stay Alive is a pop ballad that has an energy that complements the storyline that portrays confrontations between humans and the Beom tribe in a corrupt world. The title, Stay Alive, is a nod to the characters in the story as they try to survive in the vicious world. The lyrics explore an isolated boy's earnest heart and message to himself and friends who he meets. As per Soompi, Stay Alive shot to the top of iTunes Top Songs charts in 51 different regions worldwide within three hours of its release. The song became the fastest song by a Korean soloist ever to reach the No 1 spot in 80 different regions within six hours. It also became No 1 on iTunes Top Songs charts in at least 93 regions across countries within 14 hours after its release.

Taking to the comments section of the song on YouTube, ARMY praised the track. A person wrote, ""Jungkook's voice really is something else. He truly has no limits as a singer and Suga production is perfection in itself I really proud of them.""

Proud to be army,"" said a fan. ""There are like 20 vocalists in Jungkook. He is so versatile as a singer!"" commented a person. ""True fact: Jungkook vocal is a joke. His vocals so soft and healing,"" said another fan. ""This song feels like a warm hug. And Jungkooks voice is really something else...While listening to my heart was beating fast and for 2 minutes it felt like I was in a different world,"" wrote a person.

"On the show, when RM was asked about his thoughts on marriage, he revealed he is ‘really scared’ about it. He added that people born in the 1990s are currently the ones who are scared of marriage. He who thought marriage was a natural process, now looks at it differently. According to a translation by Twitter handle @mybwits, Kim Namjoon said, “I’m really scared, and for now…I think it’s very long, promise and swear eternity with one person ‘Can something like that happen in my life?’ In the past, I thought it was one of the natural processes, I chose to live an unusual life. A sudden thought for the first time a few years ago..’Maybe I’m not getting married?!’ Can you get out of control because you have that thought once?"" Namjoon’s candid thoughts seemed to have found their way into the hearts of the fans. Many took to Twitter and thanked him for opening up about the topic. Some also found it relatable. One fan wrote, “Thank you so much Kim Namjoon for saying because I live in a country where marriage defines you as a person and I hate it here and I am scared of that word just because I can’t seem to see myself tied to a person to eternity.” “Namjoon talking about not being sure about marriage is so comforting dawg,” added another fan.

About Run BTS

South Korean boy group BTS began a show called &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; on the heels of their then-just-released track &lsquo;Run&rsquo; which started off into a basic introduction and has blossomed to become a high fan favourite weekly catch-up turned occasional show  From 2015 to taking a break in late 2021 and resuming with special episodes in 2022, the show has indeed come a long way  However, it may soon have to put brakes on the run 

Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 1 Recap

The first part of show&#39;s latest editionshow introduced the fans to tiny games involving the BTS members who played card games and were subjected to lie detection under the scrutiny of each other&rsquo;s eyes as some fun &lsquo;cat ears&rsquo; (electroencephalograph ones)  Even with not a lot at play, the BTS members ensured their hilarity was at its peak best and spread joy with their content  &lsquo;Run BTS Next Top Genius Part 2&rsquo; was teased with more screaming, laughter and games at the expense of the seven members 

The dice-y game

With a lot of points at stake, the BTS members played a long winding game of dice which required them to throw it and declare a digit making others guess if they were saying the truth  If they&rsquo;re caught, they move backwards, successful and they march right ahead  With Jungkook playing a dangerous game right from the start, the BTS members had the most fun teasing him about it as he kept going back to the start point  An honest player right from the get-go, SUGA was the first to pass through and made it past the end line in a swoop  The game turned calculative and funny at a point as some of the members including RM and Jimin kept going back and forth by continuously objecting to other people&rsquo;s declarations and poking fun at each other 

The Yes or No betrayal

The fourth game was one testing the loyalties of the BTS members as they all sent out signals to each other hoping for cooperation  They were all sent to a room to ask if they&rsquo;d like to split the points with all members and had to choose yes or no  Soon after, all seven of them secretly revealed their answers and the minority would determine the winners  In tthe &lsquo;95 liners, members V and Jimin, camewho came out on top as they each picked &lsquo;No&rsquo;  The two were the top two contenders for the finals, competing in an upcoming fierce match 

Rock, Paper and Scissors

The final game to decide the winner was laid out as the infamous &lsquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rsquo; which has become known for ensuring big battles in the world of K-pop  Also frequently used to decide on the most basic things, the game was played through cards and divided the team of BTS into two, with half on the side of V and the other half on Jimin&rsquo;s side  They each had three rounds to decide their 5 cards with rock, paper or scissors on them with advice from the other members  However, only the members themselves knew their original sides ensuing a lot of suspicion and chaos  While Jimin doubted those giving him suggestions, V dedicatedly followed all that was told to him  A last spurt of 10 seconds had them change up everything adding more havoc to the already crazy game  Finally, when the other members&rsquo; loyalties were revealed, SUGA managed to fool everyone by being at Jimin&rsquo;s side all the time and in fact belonging to V&rsquo;s team, meanwhile, J-Hope&rsquo;s changing alliances finally found a home with the other 1995 star &nbsp;

Jimin was announced as the final winner of this edition of &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; and was awarded a trophy and other funny elements that the other members were not in the least bit jealous about &nbsp;

Is Run BTS ending?

Jungkook made a fleeting comment towards the end of the episode as he said, &ldquo;Yes, like this  As of today, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s ending &rdquo; making the rest of the six laugh in shock as they stopped him  They confirmed that one more episode was left to shoot  The captions confirmed that another filming schedule for &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; before Jin&rsquo;s enlistment, the last one for a while, has indeed been planned &nbsp;

While it may not mean that the show is coming to an end, it is indeed true that Jin may not be a part of the other upcoming &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episodes if the group decides to continue shooting after his enlistment which took place on December 13, though highly unlikely  This means that after another edition, &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; may end up taking another break (if they&rsquo;ve not shot for more than one episode after this) until the military services of all other members are also complete and they reconvene sometime in 2025 as previously revealed

"Ever since BTS made their Instagram debut back in December last year, BTS's V aka Kim Taehyung often deletes his photos just a few minutes after posting it. V also promised the Army that he will try and not delete them now. V's fans decided to ask him on Weverse why he keeps on deleting Stories on Instagram: “Taehyung-ah, why do you keep deleting your Instagram stories? Is it because you’re not the same person you were 5 minutes ago? Lol.” To which he replied by saying, “So I shouldn’t delete it?” He later revealed the true reason behind him deleting the Stories, “I also don’t want to delete it but when I enter the story section, I feel like changing [old stories] into something new. There’s nothing new to upload.. So since the delete button is there, I delete it.” In the end, V promised his fans that there isn't any specific reason behind him deleting the photos. He said, “It doesn’t really have a meaning lol. If you’d like it, I’ll try not to delete it.” BTS Army reacted to V's statement on Twitter. One fan wrote, “So we were right all this time.” Another one said, “Let him do whatever he's comfortable with... why do you guys order them what to do to their personal pages. I don't understand it... don't put pressure on them for every little thing.""

BM of the mixed group KARD released the solo digital single &#39;Strangers&rsquo; recently, according to the agency DSP Media  &lsquo;Strangers&rsquo; is a song that depicts the two-sided emotion of instinctive attraction towards the other person and fear that comes from ignorance With this song, BM made her solo comeback about 7 months after the song &#39;LOST IN EUPHORIA&#39; in January 2022  In addition to the title song, this digital single also includes &#39;Bad Intentions&#39;, which has the theme of ambivalence 

&#39;Strangers&#39;, which contains the tension of being attracted to a stranger, contains the instinctive attraction towards the other person, the fear that comes from ignorance, and the feelings of the boundary  With its heavy tone and deep grooves, BM transforms strange tension with strangers into a thrill, causing a transfer of emotions to listeners  The accompanying song &#39;Bad Intentions&#39; is a song about contradictory emotions  Through this song, BM wanted to say that someone&#39;s actions may differ from their intentions based on various contradictory human emotions rather than judging someone with a clear dichotomy 

BM described &#39;Strangers&#39; as a very exciting and sexy song  It&#39;s a song that makes one feel both thrilled and anxious at the same time, thrilling and a little dangerous at first sight  BM has firmly established his own music world not only as a group, but also as a solo artist  While repeating free musical attempts with sensuous beats and heavy bass, he also participates in visual work, demonstrating his stylish artistic capabilities in various fields 

BM as a KARD member and a solo artist:

Regarding his identity as a KARD member and a solo artist, he has always said that after all, while working as a group, he found a color that suits the team, gathered the worries and opinions of many people, and moved toward the best  On the other hand, as a solo artist, he knew that he could also show ideas or images that he could not show in the group activities  Both KARD activities and individual activities are always colorful, and he wants to show a limitless image as an artist 

Now, as an artist, there are so many things he could do and wants to do  He said that he wants to prove that he can do various things as an artist  As he is constantly working on individual songs, he wants his fans to look forward to his work in the future  Being a person with a different personality, he will always try new things to keep his fans entertained &nbsp;

KARD&#39;s last comeback:

KARD&rsquo;s last comeback was Ring the Alarm from their 5th mini album Re: which is a song in the Moombahton genre of the &#39;Summer Invincible&#39; card  The mood of &#39;Let&#39;s have fun in this new time&#39; was portrayed with rhythmical bass sounds and synthesizer and guitar sounds that feel the summer atmosphere  BM, who participated in writing the lyrics along with member J Seph, added weight to KARD&rsquo;s music and gave it an addictive feel with heavy rapping in a low-mid tone 

Here are some K-Pop lingo to know :-&nbsp;

Nugu- the romanization of the Korean word &lsquo;누구&rsquo; which means who and in this context nugu is for small, unknown groups of the K-Pop industry  These groups are not popular but some fans bring them forward on Twitter and Instagram to boost their popularity &nbsp;

Locals- people are not interested in K-Pop but spend time talking about how bad the industry, music, groups and other things are  They see certain incidents from the outside and give their opinion on it without understanding how the industry/culture works &nbsp;

Touching grass- it&#39;s a phenomenon where fans return to the real world/reality after being sucked into the world of K-Pop MVs, variety shows, comeback performances etc  They realize that it is time to get in touch with reality &nbsp;

Moot- Mutual follower on Twitter&nbsp;

OOMF- one of my followers&nbsp;

Soft Stan- a fan who loves the innocent and soft part of their bias or group  They prefer aegyo and babying their idols&nbsp;

Hard Stan- a fan who loves their K-Pop idols wild side and prefers when their bias displays their sex appeal during performances &nbsp;

Delulu- a delusional person

SUNGHOONED-&nbsp;like the eternal internet prank, being &lsquo;Rick-Rolled&rsquo;, SUNGHOONED is the K-Pop version where a normal video will be shown which has some suspense to it and in the end, ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Sunghoon will be shown dancing &nbsp;

Eating CDs- this means that the artist sings just as amazingly in a live performance  The slang means The artist sounds as good as they do in the recorder version &nbsp;

ult- the ultimate bias/ ultimate favourite person in the group  It also applies to a group  This slang means that the person/group comes above everybody else &nbsp;

"BTS members RM, Jin, V, and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from last year when they performed at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The video was dropped on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel on Wednesday. It showed the members recording their dance performances to their tracks Butter and Dynamite for the show. Titled BTS’s Chaotic Break Time, the video started with Jungkook giving an update about the members. ""We just finished Dynamite and Butter. We're recording it but the song (Butter) hasn't been released yet. It hasn't hit me yet. Until it's really released we'll keep preparing and practising whenever we have time."" As Jungkook spoke, V stood behind him giving directions to Jin on what to say on camera. At first, Jin spoke about his appearance in the song, ""It's not that I opened the performance fancy. I just stood up and walked. If that looked fancy all I could say is that my face was fancy."" Jin then burst out laughing and said, ""Our members are listening to this through the mic so it's a bit embarrassing."" While talking, Jin kept on shifting his glances at the camera and V. He then showed a finger heart revealing that V asked him to do so. Speaking about V, Jin said, ""He said to say something to the camera. He told me to say ‘Please look forward to it’."" As V continued giving instructions on the mic set, Jin obediently repeated it in the camera, ""He said he loves ARMY. He said he can't wait to hold a concert."" Following this, RM became the next member to feature in the clip. As soon as he showed up, Jin and V joined him and they started interrupting each other's interviews. RM started with, ""Hello. Welcome to the first day of our Butter promotion. I sincerely..."" However, he was cut off by V saying, ""You have nose hair."" As RM moved away, V said in the camera, ""Hello ARMY, I'm Kin Taehyung."" Here Jin said, ""You have mouth hair."" V walked away and Jin said, ""Hello everyone. This is Jin."" But V interrupted saying, ""You have armpit hair."" As he started talking facing the camera, RM came and said, ""You have eye hair."" Smiling at the camera, RM said, ""It's s nice to meet you guys."" As V walked into the frame asking RM, ""You got neck hair?"", Jin told the group leader, ""You look handsome today."" Finally, Jin was able to say, ""Hello. I'm Jin. What we're doing today is recording Butter. It's very awkward since no one's pushing their way in. Fighting!"" Next on V's target was Jungkook. As the youngest member said, ""We'll continue to show you good performances"" V pushed him out of the frame saying, ""Outta my way."" As the video ended, V said, ""Everyone, please look forward to it."" Last year, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook had to participate in a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Butter released in May last year and clinched the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks. The song also broke several records including Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Music Video on YouTube, Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Video on YouTube, Most-viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours by a K-pop group and Most Viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours.","As the youngest member said, ""We'll continue to show you good performances"" V pushed him out of the frame saying, ""Outta my way.

"Many users shared pictures from Empathy and Entirely for comparisons. One claimed how all of them resemble each other and wrote, “You have to be blind not to see this copy. Can't you really see? I don't blame the artist. the company should be original about the concept. Even the title..” “So RM copied D.O empathy album. Well they lack creativity right from the onset am not surprised,” added another one. Soon after, ARMY came out in support of RM. Using hashtag #BIGHITPROTECTNAMJOON, many fans brushed off accusations of plagiarism and urged others to mass mail BTS’ labels HYBE and Bighit to take action for attack against their idol. For the unversed, on August 19 RM shared the first look of Entirely. Channelling his love for photography, he shared a ‘skit’ for the solo project alongside an audio clip in which he talked about the pictorial. The group is currently on a hiatus to focus on their solo career. Before RM, it was member Jungkook who took the fans by surprise with his vampire-inspired picture-folio. BTS consists of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. However, this is not the first time that RM has been accused of plagiarism on the internet. Earlier in 2015, RM came under the scanner after Twitter users accused him of copying lines.

He said that though people appreciated him, he doesn't think he's ‘good’ or 'anything to be proud of'. Jungkook revealed that if he could speak in English throughout the concert, without a teleprompter, he’d say he ‘improved a whole lot’.

I want to receive a lot of recognition and hopefully be able to hear my own singing and think, Wow, I’m really, really good."" Speaking about the songs he wrote, Jungkook said, ""There are so many songs I’ve written that I haven’t been able to release. After making the effort to write them, I should have realised I should just edit them as much as I can and release them, but when I heard them again after a while, they didn’t sound good, so I just deleted them all.

"Korean cooking variety shows have found a niche following over time and this one happens to have included a Recording Academy winner  Earlier known for being veteran actress Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s cooking show under the name &lsquo;Youn&#39;s Kitchen&rsquo;, a spin-off series has been planned  Actor Lee Seo Jin who was one of the cast members in the second season of the show, airing from January to March 2018, will be the central character this time around 

Na Young Seok PD who is known to have been the mastermind behind multiple popular Korean variety shows including &lsquo;2 Days &amp; 1 Night&rsquo;, &lsquo;New Journey to the West&rsquo;, &lsquo;Three Meals a Day&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; as well as its earlier spin-off show &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, is said to be returning for this season of &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Seojin&rsquo;s premiere date

Earlier today, it was reported by Korean media outlets that the new restaurant variety show is in its last phase of post-production  They are said to be eyeing an early February date for the broadcast  While nothing has been confirmed, it is reported that the show will air every Friday  While the two seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; spanned over 9 and 11 episodes each, &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; had 12 episodes  A similar timeline is expected for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Cast for Seojin&rsquo;s

It was confirmed that the cast lineup for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; would include actor Lee Seo Jin, actress Jung Yu Mi, best friends and former &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; cast mates Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik  This time, however, they will be joined by another member of the famed Wooga Squad  BTS&rsquo; V has reportedly been roped in to join the cast for this spin-off show  With such a sparkling team at its disposal, &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; may as well become one of the biggest and most anticipated variety show releases of the year 

Take a look at the reasons why &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is set on the path to success 

The concept of Seojin&rsquo;s

It is known that unlike &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; which looked to promote Korean dishes through its program, this spin-off will also include lighter options for the global audience  Earlier, it was reported that the show has been shot in Mexico this season following the international filming locations of Indonesia and Spain for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo;, followed by a domestic shoot in Jeonnam in 2020 for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; 

Na PD&rsquo;s charm

A popular name in the industry, Na Young Seok PD is known to be level-headed and strict when it comes to conducting variety shows  He is hardly ever swayed by the charm of the cast before him and sticks to rules  At the same time, he creates amazingly enjoyable shows which receive great viewership ratings by adding fun segments, dire situations and unbelievable twists  &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is expected to bring his magic to the table 

Popular participants

Actor Lee Seo Jin who has been present for both the seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; and one season of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; is familiar with the overarching concept  It was observed that he was of great help during those shows and brings experience as well as leadership to the show  Turning it to focus on him after Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s decision to depart may become a successful change if he manages to pull off the role  Much like Lee Seo Jin, Jung Yu Mi has also been a part of the earlier three seasons and brings her own understanding to the show &nbsp;

Actors Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik are best friends off-camera and jokesters on camera  They have a tried and tested chemistry which was previously seen in &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, &lsquo;Summer Vacation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo; and &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo;  This time the two will be joined by BTS member V who was seen leaving for Mexico as well as spotted alongside Park Seo Joon during a restaurant visit there  The K-pop icon confirmed his participation in the show by sharing a photo from the shoot where he could be seen staring at the bright moon with a shirt with actor Lee Seo Jin&rsquo;s caricature

V for Victory

While BTS member V is known to not have a lot of skills in cooking, as previously seen during the group&rsquo;s activities including his memorable &lsquo;squirrel plate&rsquo; incident in &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;, he brings charm wherever he goes","Actors Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik are best friends off-camera and jokesters on camera.  &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is expected to bring his magic to the table 

Popular participants

Actor Lee Seo Jin who has been present for both the seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; and one season of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; is familiar with the overarching concept.  A certified &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; his synergy with the other cast members will be looked out for.  A similar timeline is expected for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Cast for Seojin&rsquo;s

It was confirmed that the cast lineup for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; would include actor Lee Seo Jin, actress Jung Yu Mi, best friends and former &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; cast mates Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik.  At the same time, he creates amazingly enjoyable shows which receive great viewership ratings by adding fun segments, dire situations and unbelievable twists.  BTS&rsquo; V has reportedly been roped in to join the cast for this spin-off show.  Earlier known for being veteran actress Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s cooking show under the name &lsquo;Youn&#39;s Kitchen&rsquo;, a spin-off series has been planned.  Earlier, it was reported that the show has been shot in Mexico this season following the international filming locations of Indonesia and Spain for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo;, followed by a domestic shoot in Jeonnam in 2020 for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; 

Na PD&rsquo;s charm

A popular name in the industry, Na Young Seok PD is known to be level-headed and strict when it comes to conducting variety shows.  He is hardly ever swayed by the charm of the cast before him and sticks to rules.  It was observed that he was of great help during those shows and brings experience as well as leadership to the show.  Much like Lee Seo Jin, Jung Yu Mi has also been a part of the earlier three seasons and brings her own understanding to the show.  They are said to be eyeing an early February date for the broadcast.  They have a tried and tested chemistry which was previously seen in &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, &lsquo;Summer Vacation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo; and &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo;.  This time the two will be joined by BTS member V who was seen leaving for Mexico as well as spotted alongside Park Seo Joon during a restaurant visit there.  This time, however, they will be joined by another member of the famed Wooga Squad.  Turning it to focus on him after Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s decision to depart may become a successful change if he manages to pull off the role.  While nothing has been confirmed, it is reported that the show will air every Friday.  While the two seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; spanned over 9 and 11 episodes each, &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; had 12 episodes.  With such a sparkling team at its disposal, &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; may as well become one of the biggest and most anticipated variety show releases of the year 

Take a look at the reasons why &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is set on the path to success 

The concept of Seojin&rsquo;s

It is known that unlike &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; which looked to promote Korean dishes through its program, this spin-off will also include lighter options for the global audience. Korean cooking variety shows have found a niche following over time and this one happens to have included a Recording Academy winner",8.460879474114094,2023-01-10T09:28:47Z,3,1

It is a harvest festival, and time when folks visit extended families and relatives. All the members were there but Jungkook was too sleepy. He said he had medicines for an allergy which could have made him drowsy. Some weird fans started off a conversation that he was possessed by the spirit of late Princess Diana on the day of the demise of the Queen Of England.

"BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood. She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Two of the four opted out leaving Lenka and Brazil’s Gabriela Dalcin as the final contestants. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm. I too wanted to pursue dancing but could not fulfil the dream as my father did not approve of it. I do not know if my daughter would become the first K-pop idol from India, but I am happy that she is living her dream.” In a statement, DR Music said Lenka and Dalcin were undergoing basic practice and Korean language education. “They will go through...six months of training. It is the final audition. We have prepared to prove through the training process that they themselves are eligible to debut as K-pop artists. Therefore, we will evaluate whether they have the basic skills to perform as a K-pop artist, such as their personality and qualities...” Sonali said her cousin’s schedule is hectic. By the time she returns to her room, she is completely exhausted. “We have formed a family WhatsApp group in which she sometimes chats. But the conversations are very brief.”","A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali.

"During the episode, the members took a trip down memory lane as they visited their dorms, spoke about eating icecreams, visiting a particular restaurant and taking walks near their dorm. They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, 'You eat it all'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, 'Back to our dorm'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn't want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other's locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed 'my friend' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, ""We can go back to a place we've been already."" He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, ""I'll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase."" However, he got shy and couldn't ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested 'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, "" I want to try pole dancing too."" RM added, ""That suits you though.""
